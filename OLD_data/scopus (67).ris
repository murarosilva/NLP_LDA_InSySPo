AB  - Multisensor data fusion is an emerging technology applied to Department of Defense (DoD) areas such as automated target recognition, battlefield surveillance, and guidance and control of autonomous vehicles, and to non-DoD applications such as monitoring of complex machinery, medical diagnosis, and smart . buildings. Techniques for multisensor data fusion are drawn from a wide range of areas including artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, statistical estimation, and other areas. This paper provides a tutorial on data fusion, introducing data fusion applications, process models, and identification of applicable techniques. Comments are made on the state-of-the-art in data fusion. Â© 1997 IEEE Publisher Item Identifier S 0018-9219(97)00775-5.

AB  - Computing, in its usual sense, is centered on manipulation of numbers and symbols. In contrast, computing with words, or CW for short, is a methodology in which the objects of computation are words and propositions drawn from a natural language, e.g., small, large, far, heavy, not very likely, the price of gas is low and declining, Berkeley is near San Francisco, CA, it is very unlikely that there will be a significant increase in the price of oil in the near future, etc. Computing with words (CW) is inspired by the remarkable human capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations. Familiar examples of such tasks are parking a car, driving in heavy traffic, playing golf, riding a bicycle, understanding speech, and summarizing a story. Underlying this remarkable capability is the brain's crucial ability to manipulate perceptions-perceptions of distance, size, weight, color, speed, time, direction, force, number, truth, likelihood, and other characteristics of physical and mental objects. Manipulation of perceptions plays a key role in human recognition, decision and execution processes. As a methodology, computing with words provides a foundation for a computational theory of perceptions-a theory which may have an important bearing on how humans make-and machines might make-perception-based rational decisions in an environment of imprecision, uncertainty and partial truth. A basic difference between perceptions and measurements is that, in general, measurements are crisp whereas perceptions are fuzzy. One of the fundamental aims of science has been and continues to be that of progressing from perceptions to measurements. Pursuit of this aim has led to brilliant successes. We have sent men to the moon; we can build computers that are capable of performing billions of computations per second; we have constructed telescopes that can explore the far reaches of the universe; and we can date the age of rocks that are millions of years old. But alongside the brilliant successes stand conspicuous underachievements and outright failures. We cannot build robots which can move with the agility of animals or humans; we cannot automate driving in heavy traffic; we cannot translate from one language to another at the level of a human interpreter; we cannot create programs which can summarize nontrivial stories; our ability to model the behavior of economic systems leaves much to be desired; and we cannot build machines that can compete with children in the performance of a wide variety of physical and cognitive tasks. It may be argued that underlying the underachievements and failures is the unavailability of a methodology for reasoning and computing with perceptions rather than measurements. An outline of such a methodology-referred to as a computational theory of perceptions is presented in this paper. The computational theory of perceptions, or CTP for short, is based on the methodology of CW. In CTP, words play the role of labels of perceptions and, more generally, perceptions are expressed as propositions in a natural language. CW-based techniques are employed to translate propositions expressed in a natural language into what is called the Generalized Constraint Language (GCL). In this language, the meaning of a proposition is expressed as a generalized constraint, X is R, where X is the constrained variable, R is the constraining relation and isr is a variable copula in which r is a variable whose value defines the way in which R constrains X. Among the basic types of constraints are: possibilistic, veristic, probabilistic, random set, Pawlak set, fuzzy graph and usuality. The wide variety of constraints in GCL makes GCL a much more expressive language than the language of predicate logic. In CW, the initial and terminal data sets, IDS and TDS, are assumed to consist of propositions expressed in a natural language. These propositions are translated, respectively, into antecedent and consequent constraints. Consequent constraints are derived from antecedent constraints through the use of rules of constraint propagation. The principal constraint propagation rule is the generalized extension principle. The derived constraints are retranslated into a natural language, yielding the terminal data set (TDS). The rules of constraint propagation in CW coincide with the rules of inference in fuzzy logic. A basic problem in CW is that of explicitation of X, R, and r in a generalized constraint, X isr R, which represents the meaning of a proposition, p, in a natural language. There are two major imperatives for computing with words. First, computing with words is a necessity when the available information is too imprecise to justify the use of numbers; and second, when there is a tolerance for imprecision which can be exploited to achieve tractability, robustness, low solution cost and better rapport with reality. Exploitation of the tolerance for imprecision is an issue of central importance in CW and CTP. At this juncture, the computational theory of perceptions-which is based on CW-is in its initial stages of development. In time, it may come to play an important role in the conception, design and utilization of information/intelligent systems. The role model for CW and CTP is the human mind. Â© 1999 IEEE.

AB  - Determining the satisfiability of randomly generated Boolean expressions with k variables per clause is a popular test for the performance of search algorithms in artificial intelligence and computer science. It is known that for k=2, formulas are almost always satisfiable when the ratio of clauses to variables is less than 1; for ratios larger than 1, the formulas are almost never satisfiable. Similar sharp threshold behavior is observed for higher values of k. Finite-size scaling, a method from statistical physics, can be used to characterize size-dependent effects near the threshold. A relationship can be drawn between thresholds and computational complexity.

AB  - This paper proposes an algorithm to consider the ramp characteristics in starting up and shutting down the generating units as well as increasing and decreasing power generation. In power system generation scheduling, a number of studies have focused upon the economical aspects of the problem under the assumptions that the changes in the generating capacity follow a step function characteristic and unit generation can be adjusted instantaneously. Even though these hypotheses greatly simplify the problem, they do not reflect the actual operating processes of generating units. The use of ramp-rate constraints to simulate the unit state and generation changes is an effective and acceptable approach in the view of theoretical developments of industrial processes. Since implementing ramp-rate constraints is a dynamic process, dynamic programming (DP) is a proper tool to treat this problem. In order to overcome the computational expense which is the main drawback of DP, this study initially employs artificial intelligence techniques to produce a unit commitment schedule which satisfies all system and unit operation constraints except unit ramp-rate limits. Then, a dynamic procedure is used to consider the ramp properties as units are started up and shut down. According to this adjustment, maximum generating capabilities of units will change with the unit operation status instead of following a step function. Finally, a dynamic dispatch procedure is adopted to obtain a suitable power allocation which incorporates the unit generating capability information given by unit commitment and unit ramping constraints, as well as the economical considerations. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the method. Â© 1993 IEEE

AB  - Sensor fusion models have been characterized in the literature in a number of distinctly different ways: in terms of information levels at which the fusion is accomplished; the objectives of the fusion process, the application domain; the types of sensors employed, the sensor suite configuration and so on. The characterization most commonly encountered in the rapidly growing sensor fusion literature based on level of detail in the information is that of the now well known triplet: data level, feature level, and decision level. We consider here a generalized input-output (I/O) descriptor pair based characterization of the sensor fusion process that can be looked upon as a natural out growth of the trilevel characterization. The fusion system design philosophy expounded here is that an exhaustive exploitation of the sensor fusion potential should explore fusion under all of the different I/O-based fusion modes conceivable under such a characterization. Fusion system architectures designed to permit such exploitation offer the requisite flexibility for developing the most effective fusion system designs for a given application. A second facet of this exploitation is aimed at exploring the new concept of self-improving multisensor fusion system architectures, wherein the central (fusion system) and local (individual sensor subsystems) decision makers mutually enhance the other's performance by providing reinforced learning. A third facet is that of investigating fusion system architectures for environments wherein the different local decision makers may only be capable of narrower decisions that span only a subset of decision choices. The paper discusses these flexible fusion system architectures along with related issues and illustrates them with . examples of their application to real-world scenarios.

AB  - A new algorithm is presented to analyze the structural features relevant to the biological activity of a set of molecules. The program called MULTICASE can, as its predecessor CASE (Computed Automated Structure Evaluator), automatically identify molecular subâstructures that have a high probability of being relevant or responsible for the observed biological activity of a learning set comprised of a mix of active and inactive molecules of diverse composition. New, untested molecules can then be submitted to the program, and an expert prediction of the potential activity of the new molecule is obtained. MULTICASE differs from CASE in a great many ways, but the major algorithmic difference is the use of Hierarchy in the selection of descriptors, leading to the concept of Biophores and Modulators.

AB  - In this paper, we review recent work aimed at the application of declarative logic programming to knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. We consider extensions of the language of definite logic programs by classical (strong) negation, disjunction, and some modal operators and show how each of the added features extends the representational power of the language. We also discuss extensions of logic programming allowing abductive reasoning, meta-reasoning and reasoning in open domains. We investigate the methodology of using these languages for representing various forms of nonmonotonic reasoning and for describing knowledge in specific domains. We also address recent work on properties of programs needed for successful applications of this methodology such as consistency, categoricity and complexity. Â© 1994.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) tools. such as expert system, fuzzy logic, and neural network are expected to usher a new era in power electronics and motion control in the coming decades. Although these technologies have advanced significantly in recent years and have found wide applications, they have hardly touched the power electronics and machine drives area. The paper describes these AI tools and their application in the area of power electronics and motion control. The body of the paper is subdivided into three sections which describe, respectively, the principles and applications of expert system, fuzzy logic, and neural network. The theoretical portion of each topic is of direct relevance to the application of power electronics. The example applications in the paper are taken from the published literature. Hopefully, the readers will be able to formulate new applications from these examples. Â© 1994 IEEE.

AB  - A genetic-based algorithm is used to solve an economic dispatch (ED) problem. The algorithm utilizes payoff information of perspective solutions to evaluate optimality. Thus, the constraints of classical LaGrangian techniques on unit curves are eliminated. Using an economic dispatch problem as a basis for comparison, several different techniques which enhance program efficiency and accuracy, such as mutation prediction, elitism, interval approximation and penalty factors, are explored. Two unique genetic algorithms are also compared. The results are verified for a sample problem using a classical technique. Â© 1995 IEEE.

AB  - This paper describes a method for feeder reconfiguration with the potential for handling realistic operating constraints. The approach taken is to set up a decision tree to represent the various switching operations available. A best-first tree searching strategy, based on heuristics, is used to evaluate the various alternatives. Switching options which could result in overloads, voltage problems, or other operating constraints, such as those associated with system protection, are quickly eliminated as possibilities. The development of a rule-based system aimed at the reduction of the search space is presented as a means of implementing the above strategy. An example is used to illustrate the concepts described above. Â© 1989 IEEE

AB  - Losses of life and property due to catastrophic failure of structures are often traced to defective welds. However, major advances have taken place in welding science and technology in the last few decades. With the development of new methodologies at the crossroad of basic and applied sciences, the promise of science-based tailoring of composition, structure, and properties of the weldments may be fulfilled. This will require resolution of several contemporary issues and problems concerning the structure and properties of the weldments as well as intelligent control and automation of the welding processes.

AB  - We introduce 3-valued stable models which are a natural generalization of standard (2-valued) stable models. We show that every logic program P has at least one 3-valued stable model and that the well-founded model of any program P [Van Gelder et al., 1990] coincides with the smallest 3-valued stable model of P. We conclude that the well-founded semantics of an arbitrary logic program coincides with the 3-valued stable model semantics. The 3-valued stable semantics is closely related to non-monotonic formalisms in AI. It can be shown that the 3-valued stable semantics has a natural extension to the class of all disjunctive logic programs and deductive databases. Finally, following upon the recent approach developed by Gelfond and Lifschitz, we extend all of our results to more general logic programs which, in addition to the use of negation as failure, permit the use of classical negation.

AB  - A distributed system comprising networked heterogeneous processors requires efficient task-to-processor assignment to achieve fast turnaround time. The authors propose two algorithms based on the A * technique, which are considerably faster, are more memory-efficient, and give optimal solutions. The first is a sequential algorithm that reduces the search space. The second proposes to lower time complexity, by running the assignment algorithm in parallel, and achieves significant speedup.

AB  - A novel approach for accurate and efficient modeling of monolithic microwave/millimeter wave integrated circuit (MMIC) components by using electromagnetic-ally trained artificial neural network (EM-ANN) software modules is presented. Full-wave EM analysis is employed to characterize MMIC components. Structures for simulation are chosen using design of experiments (DOE) methodology. EM-ANN models are then trained using physical parameters as inputs and S-parameters as outputs. Once trained, the EM-ANN models are inserted into a commercial microwave circuit simulator where they provide results approaching the accuracy of the EM simulation tool used for characterization of the MMIC components without increasing the analysis time significantly. The proposed technique is capable of providing simulation models for MMIC components where models do not exist or are not accurate over the desired region of operation. The approach has been verified by developing models for microstrip vias and interconnects in dataset circuits. A new hybrid (AS) modeling approach which makes use of existing approximate models for components is introduced and shown to be a more efficient method for developing EM-ANN models. An example of using EM-ANN models to optimize the component geometry is included. Â© 1996 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents the development and implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based, short-term system load forecasting model, for the Energy Control Center of the Pacific Gas &. Electric Company (PG & E). Insights gained during the development of the model regarding the choice of the input variables and their transformations, the design of the ANN structure, the selection of the training cases and the training process itself will be described in the paper. Attention was paid to model accurately special events such as holidays, heat-waves cold snaps and other conditions that disturb the normal pattern of the load. The significant impact of special events on the model's performance was established through testing of an existing load forecasting package that is currently in production use. The new model has been tested under a wide variety of conditions and it is shown in this paper to produce excellent results. Comparison results between the, existing regression based model and the ANN model are very, encouraging. The ANN model consistently outperforms the existing model in terms of both, average errors over a long period of time and number of âlargeâ errors. The ANN model has also been integrated with PG & Eâs Energy, Management System (EMS). It is envisioned that the ANN model will eventually substitute the existing model, to support the Company's real-time operations. In the interim both models will be available for production use.

AB  - This paper presents Newton, a branch and prune algorithm used to find all isolated solutions of a system of polynomial constraints. Newton can be characterized as a global search method which uses intervals for numerical correctness and for pruning the search space early. The pruning in Newton consists of enforcing at each node of the search tree a unique local consistency condition, called box-consistency, which approximates the notion of arc-consistency well known in artificial intelligence. Box-consistency is parametrized by an interval extension of the constraint and can be instantiated to produce the Hansen-Sengupta narrowing operator (used in interval methods) as well as new operators which are more effective when the computation is far from a solution. Newton has been evaluated on a variety of benchmarks from kinematics, chemistry, combustion, economics, and mechanics. On these benchmarks, it outperforms the interval methods we are aware of and compares well with state-of-the-art continuation methods. Limitations of Newton (e.g., a sensitivity to the size of the initial intervals on some problems) are also discussed. Of particular interest is the mathematical and programming simplicity of the method.

AB  - This article discusses Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory in terms of its utility for sensor fusion for autonomous mobile robots. It exploits two little used components of DS theory: the weight of conflict metric and the enlargement of the frame of discernment. The weight of conflict is used to measure the amount of consensus between different sensors. A lack of consensus leads the robot to either compensate within certain limits or investigate the problem further, adding robustness to the robot's operation. Enlarging the frame of discernment allows a modular decomposition of evidence. This decomposition offers the advantages of perceptual abstraction, and permits expert knowledge about the domain to be embedded in the frames of discernment, simplifying the construction and maintenance of the knowledge base. Six experiments using this Dempster-Shafer framework are presented. Data from four types of sensor data were collected by a mobile robot and fused with the Sensor Fusion Effects (SFX) architecture.

AB  - An expert system using a two-stage artificial neural network is proposed to control in real time the multitap capacitors installed on a distribution system for a nonconforming load profile such that the system losses are minimized. The required input data are directly obtained from on-line measurements which include the active and reactive line power flows, voltage magnitudes, and the current capacitor settings at certain buses. The optimum control does not involve any iteration procedure, therefore, it is computationally very efficient. Studies on a 30 bus distribution test system show the expert system to have quite satisfactory results. Â© 1989 IEEE

AB  - Condition monitoring of engine gas generators plays an essential role in airline fleet management. Adaptive diagnostic systems are becoming available that interpret measured data, furnish diagnosis of problems, provide a prognosis of engine health forplanning purposes, and rank engines for scheduled maintenance. More than four hundred operations worldwide currently use versions of the first or second generation diagnostic tools. Development of a third generation system is underway which will provide additional system enhancements and combine the functions of the existing tools. Proposed enhancements include the use of artificial intelligence to automate, improve the quality of the analysis, provide timely alerts, and the use of an Internet link for collaboration. One objective of these enhancements is to have the intelligent system do more of the analysis and decision making, while continuing to support the depth of analysis currently available at experienced operations. This paper presents recent developments in technology and strategies in engine condition monitoring including: (1) application of statistical analysis and artificial neural network filters to improve data quality, (2) neural networks for trend change detection, and classification to diagnose performance change, and (3) expert systems to diagnose, provide alerts and to rank maintenance action recommendations.Â© 1999 by ASME.

AB  - This article proposes a model of document selection by real users of a bibliographic retrieval system. It reports on Part 1 of a longitudinal study of decision making on document use by academics during an actual research project. (Part 2 followed up the same users on how the selected documents were actually used in subsequent stages.) The participants are 25 self-selected faculty and graduate students in Agricultural Economics. After a reference interview, the researcher conducted a search of DIALOG databases and prepared a printout. The users selected documents from this printout; they were asked to read and think aloud while selecting documents. Their verbal reports were recorded and analyzed from a utility-theoretic perspective. The following model of the decision-making in the selection process emerged: document information elements (DIEs) in document records provide the information for judging documents on 11 criteria (including topicality, orientation, quality, novelty, and authority); the criteria judgments are combined in an assessment of document value along five dimensions (epistemic, functional, conditional, social, and emotional values), leading to the use decision. This model accounts for the use of personal knowledge and decision strategies applied in the selection process. The model has implications for the design of an intelligent document selection assistant.

AB  - A feed forward neural network (FFNN) has been trained to discriminate between power transformer magnetizing inrush and fault currents. The training algorithm used was back-propagation, assuming initially a sigmoid transfer function for the network's processing units (âneuronsâ). Once the network was trained the units' transfer function was changed to hard limiters with thresholds equal to the biases obtained for the sigmoids during training. The off-line experimental results presented in this paper show that a FFNN may be considered as an alternative method to make the discrimination between inrush and fault currents in a digital relay implementation.

AB  - Fuzzy set theory has primarily been associated with control theory and with the representation of uncertainty in applications in artificial intelligence. More recently, fuzzy methods have been proposed as alternatives to traditional statistical methods in statistical quality control, linear regression, and forecasting, among other areas. We review some basic concepts of fuzzy methods, point out some philosophical and practical problems, and offer simpler alternatives based on traditional probability and statistical theory. Applications in control theory and statistical quality control serve as our primary examples. Â© 1995 American Statistical Association and the Amencan Society for Quality Control.

AB  - There is a growing need for humans to perforin complex remote operations and to extend the intelligence and experience of experts to distant applications. A blending of human intelligence, modern information technology, remote control, and intelligent autonomous systems is required, and the authors have coined the term teleautonomous technology, or teleautomation, for methods for producing intelligent action at a distance. Teleautomation goes beyond autonomous control in that it blends in human intelligence and action as appropriate. It goes beyond teleoperation in that it incorporates as much autonomy as is possible or reasonable. A new approach for solving one of the fundamental problems facing teleautonomous systems is discussed in detail: the need to overcome time delays due to telemetry and signal propagation. New concepts, called time and position clutches, are introduced; these allow the time and position frames, respectively, between the local user control and the remote device being controlled to be desynchronized. The design and implementation of these mechanisms are described in detail. It is demonstrated that these mechanisms lead to substantial telemanipulation performance improvements, including the novel result of improvements even in the absence of time delays. The novel controls also yield a simple protocol for handoffs of the control of manipulation tasks between local operators and remote systems. Â© 1990 IEEE

AB  - An adaptive neural network based short-term electric load forecasting system is presented. The system is developed and implemented for Florida Power and Light Company(FPL). Practical experiences with the system are discussed. The system accounts for seasonal and daily characteristics, as well as abnormal conditions such as cold fronts, heat waves, holidays and other conditions. It is capable of forecasting load with a lead time of one hour to seven days. The adaptive mechanism is used to train the neural networks when on-line. The results indicate that the load forecasting system presented gives robust and more accurate forecasts and allows greater adaptability to sudden climatic changes compared with statistical methods. The system is portable and can be modified to suit the requirements of other utility companies. Â© 1995 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, a hybrid dynamic programming-artificial neural network algorithm (DP-ANN) is studied. The proposed two-step process uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to generate a pre-schedule according to the input load profile. Then a dynamic search is performed at those stages where the commitment states of some of the units are not certain. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the execution time of the traditional dynamic programming approach without degrading the quality of the generation schedule.

AB  - A research front of rapid discovery, leaving a trail of cognitive consensus behind it, is characteristic of natural sciences since about the 17th century in Europe. The basis of this high-consensus, rapid-discovery science is not empiricism, since empirical research existed in the natural sciences before the 17th century. The key is appropriation of genealogies of research technologies, which are pragmatically manipulated and modified to produce new phenomena; high consensus results because there is higher social prestige in moving ahead to new research discoveries than by continuing to dispute the interpretation of older discoveries. The social sciences have not acquired this pattern of rapid discovery with high consensus behind the research front. Their fundamental disability is not lack of empirical research, nor failure to adhere to a scientific epistemology, nor the greater ideological controversy that surrounds social topics. What is fundamentally lacking in the social sciences is a genealogy of research technology, whose manipulation reliably produces new phenomena and a rapidly moving research front. Unless the social sciences invent new research hardware, they will likely never acquire much consensus or rapid discovery. Possibilities may exist for such development stemming from research technologies in microsociology and in artificial intelligence. Â© 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Soft computing (SC) is an association of computing methodologies that includes as its principal members fuzzy logic, neurocomputing, evolutionary computing and probabilistic computing. We present a collection of methods and tools that can be used to perform diagnostics, estimation, and control. These tools are a great match for real-world applications that are characterized by imprecise, uncertain data and incomplete domain knowledge. We outline the advantages of applying SC techniques and in particular the synergy derived from the use of hybrid SC systems. We illustrate some combinations of hybrid SC systems, such as fuzzy logic controllers (FLC's) tuned by neural networks (NN's) and evolutionary computing (EC), NN's tuned by EC or FLC's, and EC controlled by FLC's. We discuss three successful real-world examples of SC applications to industrial equipment diagnostics, freight train control, and residential property valuation.

AB  - Methods to identify transformer fault conditions before they deteriorate to a severe state include dissolved gas analysis, liquid chromatography, acoustic analysis, and transfer function techniques. All of these methods require some experience in order to correctly interpret observations. Researchers have applied artificial intelligence concepts in order to encode these diagnostic techniques. These attempts have concentrated on only a single technique and have failed to fully manage the inherent uncertainty in the various methods. In this paper, a theoretic fuzzy information model is introduced. An inference scheme which yields the âmostâ consistent conclusion is proposed. A framework is established that allows various diagnostic methods to be combined in a systematic way. Numerical examples demonstrate the developed system. Â© 1992 IEEE

AB  - In the paper different approaches are described for applying artificial neural network techniques for modelling and monitoring of machining processes (turning, milling) by sensor integration. Back propagation networks are used for state classification of tools, estimation of the tool wear and inverse modelling of the cutting process. Special emphasis is placed on the incorporation of the varying cutting conditions into the learning phase and solutions, which are based upon normal operation, i.e. cutting with sharp tools. Performances of the developed strategies are demonstrated and compared. At the end of the paper the role and perspectives of artifical neural networks in intelligent manufacturing are highlighted.

AB  - An overview of failure-tolerant control is presented, beginning with robust control, progressing through parallel and analytical redundancy, and ending with rule-based systems and artificial neural networks. By design or implementation, failure-tolerant control systems are âintelligentâ systems. All failure-tolerant systems require some degree of robustness to protect against catastrophic failure; failure tolerance often can be improved by adaptivity in decision-making and control, as well as by redundancy in measurement and actuation. Reliability, maintainability, and survivability can be enhanced by failure tolerance, although each objective poses different goals for control system design. Artificial intelligence concepts are helpful for integrating and codifying failure-tolerant control systems, not as alternatives but as adjuncts to conventional design methods. Â© 1991 IEEE

AB  - The concept of holonic manufacturing is based on the cooperation of autonomous, functionally complete entities with diverse, often conflicting goals. The paper introduces a market mechanism for coordinating the activities of intelligent agents that pursue their own interest by operating under bounded rationality in a changing, hardly predictable environment. The market model is used for solving dynamic order processing and scheduling problems: conflicts between local scheduling agents are resolved by negotiating and bargaining on simple common terms of tasks, due dates and prices.

AB  - Using a multilayered feedforward neural-network approach, the detection and diagnosis of faults in industrial processes that requires observing multiple data simultaneously are studied in this paper. The main feature of our approach is that the detection of the faults occurs during transient periods of operation of the process. A two-stage neural network is proposed as the basic structure of the detection system. The first stage of the network detects the dynamic trend of each measurement, and the second stage of the network detects and diagnoses the faults. The potential of this approach is demonstrated in simulation using a model of a continuously well-stirred tank reactor. The neural-network-based method successfully detects and diagnoses pretrained faults during transient periods and can also generalize properly. Finally, a comparison with a model-based method is presented. Â© 1997 IEEE.

AB  - A hybrid genetic/simulated-annealing approach is established for solving the thermal generator scheduling problem. It develops a method for encoding generator schedules in the hybrid approach. The method leads to a large chance of producing feasible schedules in the solution process. For the infeasible schedules produced, methods are developed to restore their feasibility. The methods developed are incorporated into the hybrid algorithm GAA2 for the determination of the most economical schedules. The original GAA2 developed previously is employed to access the cost of the generator schedules. The hybrid approach has the ability to deal with the nonconvexity of the scheduling problem. Its usefulness is demonstrated by its application to a real-life power system consisting of 13 generators.

AB  - The NeuroNames Brain Hierarchy is a structured system of neuroanatomical terminology that provides a comprehensive representation of virtually all human and nonhuman primate brain structures that are identifiable either grossly or in Nissl-stained histological sections. This system was devised for computer applications to address deficiencies in the brain terminology presented in Nomina Anatomica. English terms are listed for 783 structures in nine levels of hierarchical ranking. Abbreviations are provided for all superficial and primary volumetric structures. The substructures that constitute the total volume of every superstructure are identified. Superficial features of the brain are clearly distinguished from internal, volumetric brain structures. Structures found solely in either humans or macaques are identified. The purpose of the NeuroNames Brain Hierarchy is to bring greater standardization to the neuroanatomical terminology used by scientific investigators, clinicians, and students. This effort is consistent with the goals of the Unified Medical Language System program of the National Library of Medicine. It is hoped that the systematic construction of the NeuroNames Brain Hierarchy will facilitate use of the most widely accepted definitions of classical neuroanatomy in quantitative computerized neuroimaging applications. It should provide an accurate structural framework against which to reference the many other kinds of neuroanatomical information that are acquired by modern imaging, mapping, and histological labeling techniques.

AB  - Artificial neural networks can be used to identify hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectra of complex oligosaccharides. Feed-forward neural networks with back-propagation of errors can distinguish between spectra of oligosaccharides that differ by only one glycosyl residue in twenty. The artificial neural networks use features of the strongly overlapping region of the spectra (hump region) as well as features of the resolved regions of the spectra (structural reporter groups) to recognize spectra and efficiently recognized 1H-NMR spectra even when the spectra were perturbed by minor variations in their chemical shifts. Identification of spectra by neural networkbased pattern recognition techniques required less than 0.1 second. It is anticipated that artificial neural networks can be used to identify the structures of any complex carbohydrate that has been previously characterized and for which a 1H-NMR spectrum is available.

AB  - It is widely believed that a group of cooperating agents engaged in problem solving can solve a task faster than either a single agent or the same group of agents working in isolation from each other. Nevertheless, little is known about the quantitative improvements that result from cooperation. A number of experimental results are presented on constraint satisfaction that both test the predictions of a theory of cooperative problem solving and assess the value of cooperation for this class of problems. These experiments suggest an alternative methodology to existing techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems in computer science and distributed artificial intelligence.

AB  - The application of AI technologies using modern computers and controllers is seen as a way forward to produce higher quality components more efficiently with smaller batch sizes and more frequent changeovers. Users continue to demand better accuracy, surface integrity, and shorter cycle times with reduced operator intervention and increased flexibility. This paper reviews research into the use of AI methods to harness the knowledge and skills required to plan, set-up, operate and control grinding processes. Basic AI concepts are introduced and discussed particularly in the context of application to grinding. Two main trends are evidenced in the development of AI technologies in grinding: desktop systems to assist tool and parameter selection and self-optimising systems integrated within the machine controller. It is predicted mat future developments will favour increasing communication between these two levels of control within a CIM environment The development of modular systems which are sufficiently robust to plan, supervise and control abrasive processes requires ongoing research and development.

AB  - In 1935, Alan Mathison Turing conceived of the modern computer. He also pioneered the field of artificial intelligence (AI) proposing the famous and widely debated Turing test as a way of determining whether a suitably programmed computer can think. Among his works, his groundbreaking theoretical concepts in the exciting area of hypercomputation are the most significant. This development will one day solve problems that are deemed intractable.

AB  - Reconfigurable Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide an effective programmable resource for implementing hardware-based Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). They are low cost, readily available and reconfigurable -all important advantages for ANN applications. However, FPGAs lack the circuit density necessary to implement large parallel ANNs with many thousands of synapses. This paper presents an architecture that makes it feasible to implement large ANNs with FPGAs. The architecture combines stochastic computation techniques with a novel lookup-table-based architecture that fully exploits the lookup-table structure of many FPGAs. This lookup-table-based architecture is extremely efficient: it is capable of supporting up to two synapses per Configurable Logic Block (CLB). In addition, the architecture is simple to implement, self-contained (weights are stored directly in the synapse), and scales easily across multiple chips.

AB  - A fuzzy logic-based, multi-input/multi-output roll controller has been designed for Rockwell International's Advanced Technology Wing (ATW) aircraft model. The ATW integrates active controls with a flexible wing structure to provide wing shapes that optimize particular flight performance criteria. Because of the large variations in the dynamic model of the wing as a function of flight condition, the use of a fuzzy controller was investigated for roll rate and load alleviation control. Fuzzy rules were developed to determine the appropriate control surface deflections to achieve the desired roll rate while ensuring wing loads are within safe bounds. A novel departure of the rules from conventional control heuristics is in the modulation of damping factor according to the distance of the system state from the goal state. This damping modulation technique enables full utilization of the vehicle's acceleration capability and resulted in an improvement of the response time by a factor of two. When the wing loads are close to the bounds, control rules derived from a qualitative analysis of the plant model provide load alleviation with minimal degradation in roll performance. The resultant fuzzy controller commands six surface deflections to control the roll rate and four torsion moments. Â© 1991 IEEE

AB  - Artificial neural networks and knowledge-based systems offer very different capabilities concerning control system design, implementation, and performance. This paper presents a methodology for integrating both computational paradigms for the purpose of robotic control, patterning the integration after models of human motor skill acquisition. The initial control task chosen to demonstrate the integration technique involves teaching a two-link manipulator how to make a specific type of swing. A three-level task hierarchy is defined consisting of low-level reflexes, reflex modulators, and an execution monitor. The rule-based execution monitor first determines how to make a successful swing using rules alone. It then teaches Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) neural networks how to accomplish the task by having them observe rule-based task execution. Following initial training, the execution monitor continuously evaluates neural network performance and re-engages swing-maneuver rules whenever changes in the manipulator or its operating environment necessitate retraining of the networks. Simulation results show the interaction between rule-based and network-based system components during various phases of training and supervision. Â© 1990 IEEE

AB  - Diagnosis is a popular topic in Artificial Intelligence. Recently, we presented a knowledge-level analysis of diagnosis covering a large scope of different approaches and systems. Such analysis gives us a better understanding of diagnosis in terms of the goals it comprises and the ways to achieve these goals. In the knowledge acquisition community, libraries with reusable knowledge components are becoming increasingly important. Such libraries facilitate the knowledge acquisition process in the sense that a problem-solving strategy can be constructed from ready made parts rather than to build it up from scratch. The result of the knowledge-level analysis of diagnosis can serve as such a library. The aim of this paper is, first, to present the collection of problem-solving methods and, second, to show some experiments that explore the usefulness of the library in knowledge acquisition. In order to do the experiments, it is necessary to associate problem-solving methods with suitability criteria that reflect the conditions under which problem-solving methods are applicable.

AB  - This chapter reviews the limitations of the standard computing paradigm and illustrates the concept of quantum neural computing. Implications of this idea for the understanding of biological information processing and design of new kinds of computing machines are described. Arguments are presented in support of the thesis that brains are to be viewed as quantum systems, with their neural structures representing the classical measurement hardware. From a performance point of view, a quantum neural computer may be viewed as a collection of many conventional computers that are designed to solve different problems. A quantum neural computer is a single machine that reorganizes itself, in response to a stimulus, to perform a useful computation. Selectivity offered by such reorganization appears to be at the basis of the gestalt style of biological information processing. Clearly, a quantum neural computer is more versatile than the conventional computing machine. The proposal for a quantum neural computer is based on an explicit representation of the unity of the computation process; it defines computation as a behavior in relation to other systems. The chapter introduces computation in relative terms, a perspective that appears to be appropriate for computation related to artificial intelligence (AI) problems. Â© 1995, Academic Press Inc.

AB  - The wide variety of renewable energy resources and their highly site-specific and variable nature, coupled with different types and qualities of energy needs, pose a challenging problem to the designers of Integrated Renewable Energy Systems (IRES). This paper discusses some typical design scenarios and the formulation of designs using the knowledge-based design tool IRES-KB with the aid of KAPPAÂ®-PC development tools. A remote village with no electrical grid connection is chosen for this study since renewables are most likely to make their greatest impact in such locations. The versatility of IRES-KB is brought out in the discussion of the results. Â© 1995 IEEE

AB  - At the thirty-year anniversary of the introduction of the technique of computer-generated random-dot stereograms and random-dot cinematograms into psychology, the impact of the technique on brain research and on the study of artificial intelligence is reviewed. The main finding that stereoscopic depth perception (stereopsis), motion perception, and preattentive texture discrimination are basically bottom-up processes, which occur without the help of the top-down processes of cognition and semantic memory greatly simplifies the study of these processes of early vision and permits the linking of human perception with monkey neurophysiology. Particularly interesting are the unexpected findings that stereopsis (assumed to be local) is a global process, while texture discrimination (assumed to be a global process, governed by statistics) is local, based on some conspicuous local features (textons). It is shown that the top-down process of "shape (depth) from shading" does not affect stereopsis, and some of the models of machine vision are evaluated. The asymmetry effect of human texture discrimination is discussed, together with recent nonlinear spatial filter models and a novel extension of the texton theory that can cope with the asymmetry problem. This didactic review attempts to introduce the physicist to the field of psychobiology and its problems including metascientific problems of brain research, problems of scientific creativity, the state of artificial intelligence research (including connectionist neural networks) aimed at modeling brain activity, and the fundamental role of focal attention in mental events.

AB  - Genetic algorithms can serves as the search methodology for job shop scheduling problems. VSOP also uses domain-specific chromosome representations, recombination operators, and local enumerative search to increase efficiency. The Vanderbilt Schedule Optimizer Prototype (VSOP) takes the third approach. Our project's goals were to develop a knowledge representation formalism for a job shop scheduling, explore GAs as a viable search method, and develop a prototype problem solver for proof-of-principle.

AB  - This paper presents a basic structure of an intelligent planning environment for automated dimensional inspection using coordinate measuring machines (CMMs). Three levels of automation technology, ranging from the facility automation to information and decision automation, are discussed. At the facility level, the operations of the CMMs are examined for the dimensional inspection of various manufactured objects. In this research the dimensional inspection of objects having complex and sculptured surfaces is emphasized. At the information level, a CAD-directed inspection system is implemented. The system is composed of three key elements: CAD/CMM inspection planning module, CAD model based localization algorithm, and comparative analysis module. In addition, the concept of inspection attributes is introduced. Inspection attributes are some pieces of information that are stored in the CAD database along with the design model for inspection application. Typical inspection attributes include functional tolerances and manufacturing capability. At the decision making level, an inspection planner is proposed in conjunction with the CAD directed inspection to provide links between the CAD/CMM system and inspection goal. The planner is a knowledge based system which utilizes artificial intelligence technologies to automate the decision making in inspection planning.

AB  - As part of the ongoing Illinois Digital Library Initiative project, this research proposes an intelligent agent approach to Web searching. In this experiment, we developed two Web personal spiders based on bast first search and genetic algorithm techniques, respectively. These personal spiders can dynamically take a user's selected starting homepages and search for the most closely related homepages in the Web, based on the links and keyword indexing. A graphical, dynamic, Java-based interface was developed and is available for Web access. A system architecture for implementing such an agent-based spider is presented, followed by detailed discussions of benchmark testing and user evaluation results. In benchmark testing, although the genetic algorithm spider did not outperform the best first search spider, we found both results to be comparable and complementary. In user evaluation, the genetic algorithm spider obtained significantly higher recall value than that of the best first search spider. However, their precision values were not statistically different. The mutation process introduced in genetic algorithm allows users to find other potential relevant homepages that cannot be explored via a conventional local search process. In addition, we found the Java-based interface to be a necessary component for design of a truly interactive and dynamic Web agent.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has recently been investigated and applied with success to solve some long-standing power system problems where conventional methods experience difficulty. Tutorials previously published in the Journal have introduced expert systems and artificial neural network applications in power systems. This series of three tutorials gives practising power engineers an overview and general appreciation of the basic concepts of fuzzy logic and an insight into how this technique can be applied to solve complex power system problems. The first tutorial gives a general introduction to fuzzy logic.

AB  - The development of advanced traffic signal control strategies suitable for advanced traffic management within Intelligent Transportation Systems is described. The strategies consist of a multilevel design for the real-time, traffic-adaptive control of an urban signal network. This design permits the system to be built up gradually to offer varying degrees of responsiveness, depending on particular network and traffic characteristics. The more advanced control levels in the hierarchy incorporate the capabilities of the lower control levels. A principal goal of the multilevel design is to invoke a selected control strategy when it can provide the greatest benefits and thus maximize the overall effectiveness of the system.

AB  - This paper presents an artificial intelligence (AI) approach to the optimal reactive power (var) control problem. The method incorporates the reactive load uncertainty in optimizing the overall system performance. The artificial neural network (ANN) enhanced by fuzzy sets is used to determine the memberships of control variables corresponding to the given load values. A power flow solution will determine the corresponding state of the system. Since the resulting system state may not be feasible in real-time, a heuristic method based on the application of sensitivities in expert system is employed to refine the solution with minimum adjustments of control variables. Test cases and numerical results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Simplicity, processing speed and ability to model load uncertainties make this approach a viable option for on-line var control. Â© 1995 IEEE.

AB  - The design process associated with large engineering systems requires an initial decomposition of the complex system into subsystem modules which are coupled through transference of output data. The implementation of such a decomposition approach assumes that the ability exists to determine what subsystems and interactions exist and what order of execution will be imposed during the analysis process. Unfortunately, this is quite often an extremely complex task which may be beyond human ability to efficiently achieve. Further, in optimizing such a coupled system, it is essential to be able to determine which interactions figure prominently enough to significantly affect the accuracy of the optimal solution. The ability to determine "weak" versus "strong" coupling strengths would aid the designer in deciding which couplings could be permanently removed from consideration or which could be temporarily suspended so as to achieve computational savings with minimal loss in solution accuracy. An approach that uses normalized sensitivities to quantify coupling strengths is presented. The approach is applied to a coupled system composed of analytical equations for verification purposes.

AB  - A formal model for the coordination level of intelligent machines is established. The framework of the coordination level investigated consists of one dispatcher and a number of coordinators. The model called coordination structure has been used to describe analytically the information structure and information flow for the coordination activities in the coordination level. Specifically, the coordination structure offers a formalism to (1) describe the task translation of the dispatcher and coordinators; (2) represent the individual process within the dispatcher and coordinators; (3) specify the cooperation and connection among the dispatcher and coordinators; (4) perform the process analysis and evaluation; and (5) provide a control and communication mechanism for the real-time monitor or simulation of the coordination process. A simple procedure for the task scheduling in the coordination structure is presented. The task translation is achieved by a stochastic learning algorithm. The learning process is measured with entropy and its convergence is guaranteed. Finally, a case study of the coordination structure with three coordinators and one dispatcher for a simple intelligent manipulator system illustrates the proposed model and the simulation of the task processes performed on the model verifies the soundness of the theory.

AB  - The formulation and analysis of a short-term load forecasting algorithm is presented. The formulation of rules for the rule base and the application of such rules are discussed. The classification of the load forecast parameters into weather- and non-weather-sensitive categories is discussed. The rationale behind the development of rules for both the one-day and seven-day forecast is then presented. This exercise leads to the identification and estimation of parameters relating load, weather variables, day types, and seasons. This discussion is followed by the presentation of sample rules that are the product of identifiable statistical relationships and expert knowledge. A self-learning process, which shows how rules governing the electric utility load can be updated, is then described. Finally, results from both the one-day and seven-day forecast algorithms are presented. The seven-day forecast is generated using both accurate and predicted weather information. The monthly average load forecast errors range between 2.97% and 10.71% for the seven-day forecasts. For the one-day forecasts, the average seasonal errors range between 7.03% and 1.53%. Â© 1990 IEEE

AB  - A technique is described for integrating multlple.sensor data using a voting fusion process that combines the individual sensor outputs. An important attribute of the method is the automatic confirmation of the target by the fusion processor without the need to explicitly determine which sensors and what level of sensor participation are involved. A three-sensor system, with multiple confidence levels in each sensor, is discussed to illustrate the approach. Boolean algebra Is used to derive closed-form expressions for the multiple sensor-system detection probability and false alarm probability. Procedures for relating confidence levels to detection and false alarm probabilities are described through an application example. The paper concludes with the hardware implementation for the sensor system fusion algorithm. Â© 1993, IEEE. All rights reserved.

AB  - We describe an empirical approach to identifying the kind of task that an emotion recognition system could usefully address. Three levels of information are elicited - a basic emotion vocabulary, a basic representation in 'evaluation-activation space' of the meaning of each word, and a richer 'schema' representation. The results confirm that an approach of this kind is feasible.

AB  - Artificial neural networks applied to in vitro-in vivo correlations (ANN-IVIVC) have the potential to be a reliable predictive tool that overcomes some of the difficulties associated with classical regression methods, principally, that of providing an a priori specification of the regression equation structure. A number of unique ANN configurations are presented, that have been evaluated for their ability to determine an IVIVC from different formulations of the same product. Configuration variables included a combination of architectural structures, learning algorithms, and input-output association structures. The initial training set consisted of two formulations and included the dissolution from each of the six cells in the dissolution bath as inputs, with associated outputs consisting of 1512 pharmacokinetic time points from nine patients enrolled in a crossover study. A third formulation IVIVC data set was used for predictive validation. Using these data, a total of 29 ANN configurations were evaluated. The ANN structures included the traditional feed forward, recurrent, jump connections, and general regression neural networks, with input-output association types consisting of the direct mapping of the dissolution profiles to the pharmacokinetic observations, mapping the individual dissolution points to the individual observations, and using a 'memorative' input-output association. The ANNs were evaluated on the basis of their predictive performance, which was excellent for some of these ANN models. This work provides a basic foundation for ANN-IVIVC modeling and is the basis for continued modeling with other desirable inputs, such as formulation variables and subject demographics.

AB  - Animats - autonomous robots or simulations of animals - and the animat approach represent the most recent attempt to comprehend the capacity of animals for autonomous generation of adaptive, intelligent behavior in complex, changing environments. Motivated by perceived limitations in classical artificial intelligence (AI), the animat approach promulgates an alternative, bottom-up route to understanding intelligent behavior. Important tenets include: (1) that adaptive behavior is best understood by focusing on the interaction between a behaving individual and its environment, hence the interest in 'embodied' physical robots 'situated' in natural environments; (2) that specific abilities, 'behaviors', are more natural units of analysis and design than general, information-processing functions and world models; and (3) that high-level behaviors will emerge as systems composed of simple behavioral competences become more complex. Thus, animat research often begins with low-level sensorimotor abilities and then moves up towards higher, cognitive functions. Both in analysis and in design, the animat approach borrows heavily from ethology, psychology, neurobiology and evolutionary biology, as well as from connectionism. For AI and robotics researchers, understanding the mechanisms behind adaptive behavior is secondary to creating them, but natural scientists can hope for tools and concepts to aid understanding of biological systems.

AB  - Sargent called his latest venture Bounded Rationality in Macroeconomics and tried to make connections with Simon's programme of bounded rationality and artificial intelligence. The irony is that rational expectations theory, born from the same mother - Carnegie-Mellon University - as bounded rationality, after trying to kill her big sister, then apparently came around to embracing her in the person of Sargent But was Simon's interpretation of bounded rationality the same as Sargent's? Did Simon and Sargent mean the same by artificial intelligence? Not quite. The different interests of Sargent and Simon resulted in vastly different interpretations of bounded rationality and artificial intelligence.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is being used increasingly as an aid to diagnosis in medicine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of a neural network to predict the likelihood of an individual having a malignant or potentially malignant oral lesion based on knowledge of their risk habits. Performance of the network was compared with a group of dental screeners in a screening programme involving 2027 adults. The screening performance was measured in terms of sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios. All subjects were examined independently by a dental screener and a specialist, who provided a definitive diagnosis, or 'gold standard', for each individual. All subjects also completed an interview questionnaire regarding personal details, dental attendance and smoking and drinking habits. The neural network was trained on 1662 of the screened population using ten input variables derived from the questionnaire along with the outcome of the specialist's diagnosis. Following training, the network was asked to classify the remaining unseen proportion (365 individuals) of the screened population as positive or negative for the presence of cancer or precancer. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the dentists were 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.62â0.86] and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.985â0.994) respectively compared with 0.80 (99% CI, 0.55â1.00) and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.73â0.81) for the neural network. In view of the potential costs involved in implementing a screening programme, this neural network may be of value for the identification of individuals with a high risk of oral cancer or precancer for further clinical examination or health education.

AB  - The authors present an expert system developed in Turbo Prolog to identify faulted sections and interpret protective apparatus operation in large interconnected power systems. This expert system is capable of identifying bus faults, line fault sections, and fault sections in the common area of a specific bus and line. Also, the expert system identifies relays or breaker malfunctions. The expert system is expanded to include real-time measurements of current and voltage phasors to classify the type of fault that the faulted section has experienced. When the faulted section is a transmission line, the expert system then selects an appropriate fault location algorithm to compute the fault location in miles. The importance of using a combination of numeric and database algorithms is emphasized.

AB  - Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center is implementing a decision-support system based on the Arden Syntax for Medical Logic Modules (MLM's). The system uses a compiler-interpreter pair. MLM's are first compiled into pseudo-codes, which are instructions for a virtual machine. The MLM's are then executed using an interpreter that emulates the virtual machine. This design has resulted in increased portability, easier debugging and verification, and more compact compiled MLM's. The time spent interpreting the MLM pseudo-codes has been found to be insignificant compared to database accesses. The compiler, which is written using the tools "lex" and "yacc," optimizes MLM's by minimizing the number of database accesses. The interpreter emulates a stack-oriented machine. A phased implementation of the syntax was used to speed the development of the system.

AB  - A hybrid artificial neural network is used to model the thermodynamic behavior of the Tennessee Valley Authority's Sequoyah nuclear power plant using data for heat rate measurements acquired over a 1-yr period. The modeling process involves the use of a self-organizing network to rearrange the original data into several classes by clustering. Then, the centroids of these clusters are used as the training patterns for an artificial neural network that utilizes backpropagation training to adjust the weights on the connections between artificial neurons. This procedure greatly reduces the training time and reduces the system error. Comparison of the calculated heat rates with those predicted by the artificial neural network gives an error of < 0.1%. A sensitivity analysis is then performed by taking the partial derivative of the heat rate with respect to each individual input to secure a sensitivity coefficient. These coefficients identified the input variables that were most important to improving the heat rate and efficiency. The methodology reported is an alternative to the conventional modeling procedures used in other heat rate monitoring systems. It has the advantage that the artificial neural network model is based on actual plant data that cover the dynamic range normally occurring over an annual cycle of operation, and it is not subject to linearization or empirical approximations. This process could be utilized by existing heat rate monitoring systems.

AB  - It has been only recently that research and development on smart structures has been identified as an interdisciplinary area of activity in its own right. One of the key functionalities required for a structure to be termed "smart" is an ability to sense. Recent developments in fiber optic sensing, noncontact sensor power/interrogation, and long gauge length sensors configured as matched filters will be critical to the successful development of the smart structures of the future. A formal definition of a smart structure is provided and sensing requirements and potential sensing alternatives are discussed.

AB  - Existing fault diagnostic techniques for power systems are based on the operation of breakers using on-line alarm messages available from the Energy Management Systems (EMSs). Some utility systems also acquire, on-line, the information on relay operations in order to increase the precision of fault diagnosis. This paper proposes a new on-line fault diagnosis system called Intelligent Alarm Analyzer (IAA). This paper identifies the information from sequence-of-events recorders (SERs) at the substations that can be used in the EMS environment. The breaker operations together with the selected SER information provide sufficient data to help pinpoint the fault location(s) and malfunctioning devicc(s) online. The proposed IAA is capable of handling transmission line, busbar and transformer faults as well as relay and breaker malfunctions. The other unique feature of IAA is its logic-based algorithms implemented in an object-oriented software structure. Based on our testing with the actual data from ENEL, the Italian power system, the proposed implementation is highly efficient and promising for the on-line environment. Â© 1996 IEEE.

AB  - This paper describes a software program for Macintosh computers which assists with the analysis of qualitative data. HyperRESEARCH is a HyperCard-based application that allows for qualitative and quantitative analysis of textual, graphic audio, and video materials. HyperRESEARCH performs the following tasks: (1) The coding of text (of any length: a word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, etc.), graphics, coding of audio, video tapes using Tandberg computer controlled tape decks and several types of computer controlled video systems (video disc and video tape). A given segment of text, graphic, audio and video can be assigned multiple codes. (2) Retrieval of coded materials (text, graphics, audio and video segments) enabling the researcher to array all similarly coded material together. (3) The testing of propositions by performing Boolean searches on any code or combination of codes via the use of an expert system. (4) Hypothesis testing using artificial intelligence. The Expert System software technology uses production rules to provide a semi-formal mechanism for theory building and description of the inference process used to draw conclusions from the data. (5) A statistical option which allows for the simple analysis of coded data. The use of HyperRESEARCH as a methodological tool supports important advances in the validation, reliability and generalizability of qualitative data analysis. Â© 1991 Human Sciences Press, Inc.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of two popular knowledge representation schemes as communication vehicles between the human expert and the knowledge engineer. Validation by the human expert of the knowledge encapsulated depends upon how well the expert understands and interprets a representation scheme. A between-group experiment was conducted. Each group received two treatments of the same representation technique, with the second treatment slightly more complex that the first. All the scores for the Semantic Network representations were higher than that obtained for the Predicate Logic representations; and the Semantic Network were clearly better for comprehension and conceptualization tasks. The results demonstrate some of the weaknesses of Predicate Logic and some of the strenths of Semantic Networks as communication tools during the validation process. Â© 1990 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - The current state of the art in computational aerodynamics for whole-body aircraft flowfield simulations is described. Recent advances in geometry modeling, surface and volume grid generation, and flow simulation algorithms have led to accurate flowfield predictions for increasingly complex and realistic configurations. As a result, computational aerodynamics has emerged as a crucial enabling technology for the design and development of flight vehicles. Examples illustrating the current capability for the prediction of transport and fighter aircraft flowfields are presented. Unfortunately, accurate modeling of turbulence remains a major difficulty in the analysis of viscosity-dominated flows. In the future, inverse design methods, multidisciplinary design optimization methods, artificial intelligence technology, and massively parallel computer technology will be incorporated into computational aerodynamics, opening up greater opportunities for improved product design at substantially reduced costs.

AB  - Previous work [1] has shown the viability of using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the early detection and control of overloaded lines. This paper focuses on the development of an artificial neural network based scheme for intelligent load shedding. The load shedding scheme consists of localized detectors that consider parameters of the power system during an emergency. The research was developed using the IEEE 30 bus test system which incorporates a design of net import and export regions. The approach is implemented in the import area of the system. The purpose of the scheme is to detect overloaded lines and make intelligent decisions about where within the topology of the system the load should be dropped and how much load to shed. The proposed scheme is designed to avoid unintentional separation of the system by fast, proactive, and adaptive control. Â© 1993 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, centralized/distributed recursive algorithms for temporal-spatial information integration using the Dempster-Shafer technique are developed. Compared with the Bayesian approach, the Dempster-Shafer technique has the strong capability of handling information uncertainties which Is especially desired in many applications. In the centralized integration algorithm, all information is pooled into the central processor and integrated. In contrast, the distributed integration algorithm shares the computational burden among the local processors, which increases the computational efficiency. The developed algorithms are effectively applied to a target identification problem with three sensors: identification of friend-foe-neutral (IFFN), electronic support measurement (ESM), and infrared search and track (IRST).

AB  - IMPACTS (IMage Processing for Automatic Computer Traffic Surveillance) is a computerised method of analysing video images that provides information on the location and extent of stationary and moving traffic within the scene. This new information is capable of detecting the formation of queues and stop-go waves in the traffic flow and can provide the basis for a variety of traffic monitoring systems, including congestion monitoring and incident detection. Recent trials of a pilot installation using images from a single, gantry-mounted, camera on the M25 London Orbital Motorway have verified the operation of the basic algorithm and provided some measures of performance. Improvements in performance can be achieved by looking at how the spatial information from IMPACTS changes over time. The results obtained from this trial highlight the advantages of such spatial detection techniques over more conventional point detector techniques. -from Author

AB  - The task of legal research is complex, requiring an understanding of multiple interpretations of legal language, an awareness of the relationships between judicial decisions, and an ability to use analogical reasoning to find relevant documents. Attempts to automate parts of the process with computers have met with limited success. We describe a system called SCALIR which attempts to remedy these problems by combining connectionist and symbolic artificial intelligence approaches. This hybrid representational scheme gives SCALIR the ability to make both associative and deductive inferences. The system also provides an alternative to the traditional view of computer-assisted legal research by using a direct-manipulation style, interface, making searches into an interactive process, and by employing user feedback to improve its performance over time. In addition, we suggest a further application of SCALIR to a part of the analogy task, and argue that this approach is complementary with case-based reasoning techniques.

AB  - Decision-support systems hold a specialized body of knowledge in computerized form such that the non- specialist can obtain expert-level information. The goal of these systems in clinical sciences is usually to assist patient care by providing the clinician with improved diagnosis or treatment planning. Decision-support systems consist of three components: the user interface through which the clinician or patient enters signs or symptoms, the set of data describing clinical knowledge in the domain of the program, and an inference engine to manipulate the data set in light of a patient's specific signs or symptoms to arrive at a diagnosis or treatment plan. Such systems usually use one of three mechanisms of analysis alone or in combination: classification trees, Bayesian conditional probabilities, or rule-based (heuristic) systems. Numerous problems must be solved before decision-support systems will become commonplace in clinical practice. Data entry of patients' signs and symptoms is often tedious. The quality of the clinician's initial observations is of great importance in determining the quality of the output. It is also often difficult to convey to a program the subtlety of clinical information observed. Knowledge required in clinical data bases is often unavailable or imprecise. As these and other challenges are addressed we can anticipate increased utility of decision support programs in the future.

AB  - The cutting stock problem is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. The scope of this paper is to provide a basis for exploring the integration of the evolutionary algorithm technique in artificial intelligence with classic two-dimensional cutting stock problems, with minimum trim loss. The algorithm we have developed can be used to solve non-guillotine, two-dimensional cutting stock problems. This algorithm addresses the problem of placing differently-sized small rectangles on a larger rectangle or box, in order to minimize the trim loss. The algorithm is programmed in C/C++ and runs on a personal computer with an Intel 486-based CPU. The algorithm is tested using randomly generated test cases. The problem was also formulated as an integer programming problem. Computational, experience is discussed.

AB  - Modern business enterprises, such as AT&T, are finding the need to warehouse huge volumes of data with the expectation of mining it for knowledge. These businesses hope to determine trends and patterns that could improve their organization's effectiveness, efficiency, and prospects. The continuous increase in size and complexity of these telecommunication networks require intelligent systems to help manage and maintain these networks. For optimum efficiency, these systems should be able to analyze and resolve problems in the network automatically. Thus, the network's reliability and quality is greatly improved by these intelligent systems.

AB  - There are various kinds of autonomous vehicles (AV's) which can operate with varying levels of autonomy. This paper is concerned with underwater, ground, and aerial vehicles operating in a fully autonomous (nonteieoperaÃ®ed) mode. Further, this paper deals with AV's as a special kind of device, rather than full-scale manned vehicles operating unmanned. The distinction is one in which the AV is likely to be designed for autonomous operation rather than being adapted for it as would be the case for manned vehicles. We provide a survey of the technological progress that has been made in AV's, the current research issues and approaches thai are continuing that progress, and the applications which motivate this work. It should be noted that issues of control are pervasive regardless of the kind of AV being considered, but that there are special considerations in the design and operation of AV's depending on whether the focus is on vehicles underwater, on the ground, or in the air. We have separated the discussion into sections treating each of these categories. Â©1996 IEEE.

AB  - The objectives of our work are to develop methodologies capable of identifying the potential environmental health hazards of chemicals. These techniques are particularly useful when it is necessary to evaluate molecules that have not been synthesized as yet, or for which there is little or no toxicological information known. With the help of MULTICASE, an artificial intelligence program capable of uncovering the relationship between the presence of specific structures in a molecule and its toxicity, and TOX II, a program capable of identifying the existence of such structures in a new molecule, it is now possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty whether a new molecule will be toxic. TOX II will uncover any functionality previously found to be related to toxicity in any organic molecule. The evaluation is extensive and may include its automatically generated metabolites. The scope of TOX II is vast as more than 70 toxicological endpoints can be evaluated. Â© 1995.

AB  - One of the central issues of intelligent CAD is building a modeling mechanism that deals with multiple models. The basis on which a model is built, which we call ontology, may vary over domains of modeling, abstraction and approximation levels, and granularities. This paper discusses integration of design object models over multiple ontologies. The key idea is the use of meta-level model about relationships among models. The meta-level model, which we call the metamodel, is used for reasoning about how models should be generated and modified so that consistency among them can be maintained. The use of the metamodel is illustrated by an example of modeling a hydrofoil. Â© 1994 CIRP.

AB  - A system is being developed, based on structure generation methods, for the design of molecules to fit a variety of constraints. The system is modular and uses techniques from artificial intelligence to solve general problems in molecule design. Heuristics are being developed based, in part, on the different kinds of constraints that might be available to the system, e.g., the shape and electrostatic nature of a cavity. The heuristics are then used to restrict the combinatorial explosion that is inherent in structure generation. The program has been tested using the appa binding site of Trypsin and a range of different structures that fit the site have been generated. Some of these structures are very closely related to appa and the predictive value of the program has also been demonstrated. Â© 1992.

AB  - In 1976, Congress created the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) to examine the implications of computer and other information technologies and to advise Congress on whether it would be wise to assimilate these new technologies into the existing copyright regime. Ever since, a number of people have voiced criticisms of CONTU's recommendations, arguing for a modification of the current copyright regime or even a different legal structure for these issues. Although these critics have many different approaches, they share the fear that incorporating these technologies into the current copyright system will lead to overprotection. In this Article, Professor Miller examines these arguments and concludes that CONTU's recommendations were correct and that the current regime is flexible enough to address the critics' concerns. First, Professor Miller surveys the progress of the court decisions involving computer programs, and demonstrates that a set of coherent copyright principles is beginning to develop in this area. Next, Professor Miller discusses the newer phenomenon of artificial intelligence, and utilizes copyright principles that have developed in the areas of computer programs and databases to demonstrate that at its current stage of development, artificial intelligence does not pose any significant obstacles to copyright analysis. Finally, Professor Miller addresses the claim that it eventually will be impossible to assimilate computer-generated works into the copyright system because they may have no obvious human author, and concludes not only that the caselaw contains no persuasive objection to extending copyright protection to these works, but also that such an extension would fulfill the constitutional imperative of promoting progress in these areas.

The Baker Court did note, however, that if the information could not be used without the particular expression, then the latter would "be considered as necessary incidents to the art" and no protection would be given. Id. at 103. The basic concept - that a useful idea is not copyrightable but a particular expression of it is - was extended in Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201 (1954), which held that the figure-shaped base of a lamp, even if utilitarian, was nonetheless copyrightable as a work of art, see id. at 217-18. Mazer validated the position that copyright includes "non-literary" forms of expression and media, see id.; prior to that case, there had been some doubt as to whether the Constitution's Copyright Clause, U.S. CONST, art. 1, Â§ 8, cl. 8, was applicable, see Mazer, 347 U.S. at 217-18.

See Nycum & Fong, supra note 378, at 6. The authors note that "[t]pically . . . a user will direct the computer system by describing the problem to be solved or the style of composition desired." Id. They conclude that a court would apportion ownership by applying traditional copyright analysis. However, they note that, given the state of technology in 1985 (the time of their article), the user normally would be the sole author even though he has taken advantage of computerized aids in the process. See id; See Whitford Report, supra note 378, Â¶ 132. The Whitford Committee considered the computer to be a mere tool used in the creation of a work. Therefore: [I]t is clear that the author of the output can be none other than the person, or persons, who devised the instructions and originated the data used to control and condition the computer to produce the particular result. In many cases it will be a matter of joint authorship. We realise this in itself can cause problems, but no more than in some other fields, and we are not convinced there is a need for special treatment. Id; note; note; See Milde, supra note 378, at 393-95. The author believes that when the computer exercises independent creation, it is at least a co-author (with the programmer and the person who provided it with data) of the work it creates. See id. Milde also concludes that when the output of a computer contains any "deviations from its input," the output is "written" by the computer.

See Butler, supra note 378, at 744-45. Butler considers attributing authorship to a fictitious human to be "an alternative which avoids the[] pitfalls" of trying to find the real human responsible for the authorship of the computer-generated work. Id. at 744. Courts called upon to determine authorship and ownership of the products of artificial intelligence programs should "presume the existence of a fictional human author and assign the appropriate fractions of the copyright rights to the owner of the AI software copyrights, the problem-specifier or the computer owner, either individually, jointly or in part."

Professor Nimmer's treatise questions Judge Hand's reasoning to the extent it suggests that the 1909 Copyright Act exempted photographs from the originality requirement. See 1 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT, supra note 36, Â§ 2.08[E][1], at 2-126.2 to -126.3. However, it accepts Judge Hand's view that all photographs inevitably are affected by the author's personality and concludes that almost any photograph "may claim the necessary originality to support a copyright merely by virtue of the photographers' personal choice of subject matter, angle of photograph, lighting, and determination of the precise time when the photograph is to be taken." Id.; see also infra pp. 1071-72 (discussing the copyrightability of photographs and video recordings); See supra p. 1049; See Jeweler's Circular, 274 F. at 933; 412 U.S. 546 (1973); Id. at 561 (citing Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, 111 U.S. 53, 58 (1884); The Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82, 94 (1879)). That interpretation could be read, as CONTU read it, to imply a limitation to human labor only. See CONTU FINAL REPORT, supra note 1, at 45. However, CONTU did not cite Goldstein as holding that our system requires human authorship Goldstein was referred to in a discussion of the originality requirement, in which CONTU noted that only a modicum of effort was required. See id; See Goldstein, 412 U.S. at 561-62; Id at 561; The United States Congress has confirmed the American view that sound recordings are protectable "writings of an author": The copyrightable elements in a sound recording will usually, though not always, involve "authorship" both on the part of the performers whose performance is captured and on the part of the record producer responsible for setting up the recording session, capturing and electronically processing the sounds and compiling and editing them to make the final sound recording.

In fact, the court concluded that, even if an author was copying a pre existing work and unintentionally produced a distinguishable variation (for example, as a result of being frightened by a clap of thunder), that variation would be sufficient to support a copyright so long as the "author" (the court used quotation marks) adopted it as his own. See id. at 104-05. Note that, if the court's position is correct, the variation; 545 F. Supp. 812 (E.D.

Franklin Computer Corp., 714 F.2d 1240, 1242 (3d Cir. 1983), cert. dismissed, 464 U.S. 1033 (1984). The court of appeals did not express any opinion on the copyrightability of computer-generated works; 111 S. Ct. 1282 (1991). The case is discussed above at pp. 1040-41; Id. at 1288-90; Id. at 1288. 431 The Feist case, however, obviously casts doubt on the continued validity of some of the extremely broad assumptions about the de minimis character of the originality requirement that emanate from cases such as Jewelers' Circular and Catalda, discussed above. See pp. 1062-64; See Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, Â§ 1, 1 Stat. 124, 124 (repealed 1802); (1985) Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, p. 117; 
note; See supra pp. 1049-53; Indeed, this is suggested by the fact that the French term for copyright is "right of the author," and other languages use similar terms.

note; note; U.S. CONST. art. I, Â§ 8, cl. 8; supra note 49; Again, there are numerous reasons to believe that this is so. First, no precedent precludes a construction of "Authors" to include nonhuman creators. See supra pp. 1059-65. Second, the text of the Copyright Act does not preclude it. See supra p. 1065. Third, policy reasons do not preclude such a construction. See supra pp. 1066-67. Fourth, even if such a meaning of "Author" were literally precluded, currently there is a human author somewhere in the process who can qualify. See supra pp. 1037-38, 1066-67. Finally, recourse to legal fictions, as in other contexts, can satisfy the Clause's requirements. See, e.g., Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101-06 recognizing that legal fictions are necessary under the state action doctrine "to permit the Federal courts to vindicate Federal rights and hold state officials responsible to 'the supreme authority of the United States' " (quoting Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 160 (1908)); See supra notes 340-341 and accompanying text; CONTU FINAL REPORT, supra note 1, at 1; See id. at 43-46; Id. at 44; Id; Id; Id. at 45; Id; See supra pp. 1062-64; CONTU FINAL REPORT, supra note 1, at 45 (footnote omitted). CONTU continued, in words that (as discussed above) may have exaggerated the need for human authorship, to conclude. "The eligibility of any work for protection by copyright depends not upon the device or devices used in its creation, but rather upon the presence of at least minimal human creative effort at the time the work is produced." Id. If this was an overstatement of the law, it was excusable at the time because it reflected CONTU's gloss on the now compromised analysis of Alfred Bell & Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts, Inc., 191 F.2d 99 (2d Cir. 1951), see supra pp. 1063-64; supra note 432, which the Commission discussed in a passage just preceding the quoted language, see CONTU FINAL REPORT, supra note 1, at 45; CONTU FINAL REPORT, supra note 1, at 44; See id; Id. at 45; Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v.

AB  - We have developed a decision-support tool, the AIDS Intervention Decision-Support System (AIDS2), to assist in the task of matching patients to therapy-related research protocols. The purposes of AIDS2 are to determine the initial eligibility status of HIV-infected patients for therapy-related research protocols, and to suggest additional data-gathering activities that will decrease uncertainty related to the eligibility status. AIDS2 operates in either a patient-driven or protocol-driven mode. We represent the system knowledge in three combined levels: a classification level, where deterministic knowledge is represented; a belief-network level, where probabilistic knowledge is represented; and a control level, where knowledge about the system's operation is stored. To determine whether the design specifications were met, we presented a series of 10 clinical cases based on actual patients to the system. AIDS2 provided meaningful advice in all cases.

AB  - The complexity of cranioplasty increases with increased defect size. It is difficult to produce a symmetric, accurate implant presurgically or at the time of surgery when the defect is greater than 50 cm2. The procedure is also more difficult to perform when the defect is located in the temporal, infratemporal, or frontal areas. A new procedure generates a three-dimensional cast of the skull through computed tomography and computer-aided design reformation. This article describes the process of model generation and the production of a preprocessed cranial implant. To date, six cranial implants have been made with this technique. The whole head models are accurate and help the neurosurgeon-prosthodontist team in the creation of a symmetric, anatomically correct restoration. It is the technique of choice for large implants or where the cranial bones are thin. It is not necessary to augment or alter the implant during surgery. The technique reduces surgical time, and postsurgical complications have been minimal. Â© 1992 The Editorial Council of The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.

AB  - This paper presents a new model building methodology which, given a detailed mechanistic model of a task, can optimally produce a set of models with layered abstraction according to the user's specified modeling objectives. These layered models can be used to evaluate decisions made at different levels of abstraction during a typical problem-solving process such as engineering design and planning. In our research, the model building process is viewed as a learning activity and inductive machine learning techniques from AI are combined with traditional optimization methods to form our prototype model building system called AIMS (Adaptive and Interactive Modeling System). The layered analysis models built by AIMS offer several distinctive advantages over those traditional analysis models which can only provide evaluations at very detailed stages of decision making.

AB  - An expert system for the identification of linear multiple input single output systems in ARARX form, written with the OPS83 rule-based programming language, is presented. Provided with a data set, the expert system will organize an intelligent search through the set of candidate structures, and end up with a "best" model according to a "quality index" that incorporates a number of validation criteria. Tests on both industrial and simulated data have shown that the expert system behaves as well as human experts, with considerable savings in time. Â© 1990.

AB  - Engineers are developing a breed of factory workers willing to put in long hours for no pay. It is a kind of software, based on artificial intelligence (AI) research, that can move itself from place to place to help people work effectively. Known as agents, these artificial assistants are software components that live inside computer environments. Agents are made in a variety of forms to perform all sorts of useful work. At first, agents are constrained to a single computer or to a single computing environment and the tasks they do are pre-established. Agents are breaking this bond that confines them to a single environment while learning ways of accomplishing tasks on their own, based on their experience, in order to move from place to place.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce two new multiobjective optimization techniques based on the genetic algorithm (GA), and implemented as part of a multiobjective optimization tool called MOSES (Multiobjective Optimization of Systems in the Engineering Sciences). These methods are based in the concept of min - max optimum, and can produce the Pareto set and the best trade-off among the objectives. The results produced by these approaches are compared to those produced with other mathematical programming techniques and GA-based approaches using two engineering design problems, showing the new techniques' capability to generate better trade-offs than the approaches previously reported in the literature.

AB  - The common fault in distribution systems due to line outages consists of single-line-to-ground (SLG) faults, with low or high fault impedance. The presence of arcing is commonplace in high impedance SLG faults. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques have been introduced for low/high impedance fault diagnosis in ungrounded distribution systems and high impedance fault diagnosis in grounded distribution systems. So far no tool has been developed to identify, locate and classify faults on grounded and ungrounded systems. This paper describes an integrated package for fault diagnosis in either grounded or ungrounded distribution systems. It utilizes rule based schemes as well as artificial neural networks (ANN) to detect, classify and locate faults. Its application on sample test data as well as field test data are reported in the paper. Â© 1996 IEEE.

AB  - The history, philosophy, and sociology of science inform us that expert knowledge is comprised of context-dependent, personally constructed, highly functional but fallible abstractions. Moreover, experts can be understood as performing a societal role that they were chosen to play as a result of a constituency selection. Nevertheless, we propose that evolutionary epistemology, or more specifically a natural selection analogy, provides a compelling basis for believing that some expert knowledge is more than merely disposable cultural myths or highly local personal fabrications. We examine the relation between individual and social processes involved in the production of expertise. Finally, we show how this perspective allows a philosophical position which avoids both simplistic realism and complete relativism, and discuss some implications for knowledge engineering.

AB  - In recent years researchers have become increasingly convinced that the performance of information retrieval systems can be greatly enhanced by the use of key phrases for automatic conceptual document indexing and retrieval. In this article we describe two programs, INDEX and INDEXD, which locate repeated phrases in a document, gather statistical information about them, and rank them according to their value as index phrases. The programs show promise as the basis for a sophisticated conceptual indexing system. The simpler program, INDEX, ranks phrases in such a way that frequently occurring phrases which contain several frequently occurring words are given a high ranking. INDEXD is an extension of INDEX which incorporates a dictionary for stemming, weighting of words and validation of syntax of output phrases. Sample output of both programs is included, and we discuss plans to combine INDEXD with linguistic and artificial intelligence techniques to provide a general conceptual phraseâindexing system that can incorporate expert knowledge about a given application area.

AB  - This paper presents an automated tool for optimizing the routing of primary cables in underground residential distribution systems (URD). Although initially developed as one of the modules in Puget Sound Power & Light Co.'s automated electrical plat design program, Automated Primary Router (APR) can also be used in standalone mode. APR, implemented in a Geographic Information System (GIS) -based environment, is capable of efficiently accessing and manipulating geographically referenced data from a facilities management system database. It also provides a full-fledged Graphic User Interface, along with on-line visualization and accurate cost estimation to facilitate the design process. APR employs a heuristic search algorithm to find the best primary cable routes either for new residential developments, or for existing URD systems as part of the ongoing cable replacement program. Based on the test results, APR shows significant stability and efficiency in finding the optimal solution for primary cable routing. With this performance, APR can help distribution engineers improve the quality of URD design, producing standardized and economically justifiable primary cable routes. Because geographically referenced design data are digitally stored in the GIS database, APR further increases the reusability and accessibility of the URD design information. Â© 1995 IEEE.

AB  - The fouling of venturi meters, used for steam generator feedwater flow rate measurement in pressurized water reactors (PWRs), may result in unnecessary plant power derating. On-line monitoring of these important instrument channels and the thermal efficiencies of the balance-of-plant components are addressed. The steam generator feedwater flow rate and thermal efficiencies of critical components in a PWR are estimated by means of artificial neural networks. The physics of these systems and appropriate plant measurements are combined to establish robust neural network models for on-line prediction of feedwater flow rate and thermal efficiency of feedwater heaters in PWRs. A statistical sensitivity analysis technique was developed to establish the performance of this methodology.

AB  - Cost engineering and the role of the cost engineer have evolved and changed as information technology has developed. Cost engineers have been in the forefront of the computer revolution, introducing computing technology to the construction site as well as to the design office. The computer has long been recognized as a powerful design tool that is also essential in modern accounting; however, the full-scale introduction of the computer to the job site has largely been the responsibility cost engineers. This article discusses some aspects of a new and exciting computing technology that, if nurtured properly, will not follow the path of typically unwieldy expert systems, but instead will emerge as a tool to be widely used by practicing cost professionals in their day-to-day functions.

AB  - This article describes a tool that the authors developed to assist the formwork engineer/planner in selecting a vertical formwork system. The tool was developed by systematically capturing the expertise of people involved in all phases of the life of the formwork, from design through erection and concrete placement to removal. The end result is a body of decision rules and knowledge represented as an expert system. Subjects covered include form types, formwork selection factors, the WALLFORM expert system, and others.

AB  - The design of the electrical supply system for new residential developments (electrical plat design) is an everyday task for electric utility engineers. Presently this task is carried out manually resulting in an overdesigned, costly, and nonstandardized solution. As an ill-structured and open-ended problem, the plat design is difficult to automate with conventional approaches such as operational research or CAD. An additional complexity in automating the plat design is imposed by the need to process spatial data such as circuitsâ maps, records, and construction plans. The proposed Intelligent Decision Support System for Automated Electrical Plat Design (IDSS for AEPD) is an engineering tool, aimed at automating plat design. The IDSS for AEPD combines the functionality of a geographically referenced database with the sophistication of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deal with the complexity inherent in this type of problem. This paper presents the concept of the AEPD tool currently under development at Puget Sound Power & Light Co. (PSPL) and the University of Washington (UW). The implementation issues and results are presented in a companion paper [2]. Â© 1993 IEEE

AB  - Inexperienced users typically obtain one of three possible outcomes when they search for online information: They are buried under an information avalanche, they are unable to locate any useful information at all, or they find what they need in roughly the amount they need. Unfortunately, the latter outcome is the most rare. Unfamiliarity with search tactics creates difficulties for many users of online retrieval systems. When faced with poor results, even experienced searchers may use vocabulary incorrectly and often fail to reformulate their queries. Far from being the answer to everyone's information dreams, distributed sources of online information, i.e., the World Wide Web (WWW), compound the problem and may often turn into an information nightmare. To address this problem, intelligent online search assistants, or agents, are being developed for information retrieval applications. There are many approaches, both theoretical and implemented, to using intelligent software agents for information retrieval purposes. These approaches range from desktop agents specialized for a single user to networks of agents used to collect data from distributed information sources, including Web sites. This article presents an overview of intelligent software agents in information retrieval, including an explanation of agents and agent architectures, and presents several agent systems. We distinguish between agents as individual entities, whose properties and characteristics we describe separately, and agent systems as collections of agents utilized for information retrieval tasks, which we discuss in terms of individual implementations.

AB  - Today's complex manufacturing systems operate in a changing environment rife with uncertainty. The performance of manufacturing companies ultimately hinges on their ability to rapidly adapt their production to current internal and external circumstances. Two main kinds of approaches to dealing with the enumerated problems are: to enhance the reactivity of traditionally structured (mostly hierarchical) systems by sophisticated new control techniques, and to construct decentralised, distributed systems. Along both of these - overlapping - lines, the authors developed a genetic algorithm (GA) based dynamic scheduler [4] and a distributed, agent-based shop floor control system to be introduced here which relies on the holonic concept The approaches are realised by using an object-oriented framework for developing and testing new control architectures and algorithms in the manufacturing domain Finally, the co-operative use of agent-based distributed control structures and the more centralised (GA-based) scheduler is proposed aiming at systems which can handle critical complexity, reactivity, disturbance and optimality issues at the same time.

AB  - Many phases of rational drug design involve finding solutions to large combinatorial problems for which an exhaustive search is intractable. A simulation of the evolutionary pressure of natural selection can be incorporated into artificial intelligence algorithms to rapidly find good, if not optimal, solutions to such problems. This review describes implementations and select applications of genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming in various aspects of rational drug design. Evolutionary methods have been developed in the areas of pharmacophore elucidation, lead discovery and lead optimization, as well as in many areas of peripheral importance to rational drug design.

AB  - Singapore has had a transport strategy in place for two decades aimed at minimising the need to travel, a modest and efficient road network, improvements to public transport and management of demand for travel such as via road pricing. This article examines the area licence scheme which was first implemented in 1975. Details are given of the success of area licensing inside the restricted zone and the effect on different classes of vehicle. Travel speeds, modal split, impacts outside of the zone and cost/revenue are also described. -D.Jarratt

AB  - A framework for aiding the construction of simulation models in system design problems is presented. The framework employs concepts of artificial intelligence and simulation modeling. A knowledge representation scheme called system entity structure expresses information about the structure of the system to be designed and its corresponding models. More specifically, the entity structure represents objects and their attributes, decompositions, and taxonomies. A knowledge base of production rules is defined for a given design domain and is incorporated in an expert system shell which recommends a feasible configuration of design objects from the system entity structure, based on specific design objectives, constraints, and requirements. This configuration is a basis for constructing a model of the system. The methodology for constructing the system entity structure and its corresponding rule base is presented. A case study based on a high level robot design problem is discussed to illustrate the conceptual framework.

AB  - A significant increase in the information processing abilities of CNN's demands powerful information processing at the cell level. In this paper, the defining formula, the main properties, and several applications of a novel coupling cell are presented. Since it is able to implement any Boolean function, its functionality expands on those of digital RAM's by adding new capabilities such as learning and interpolation. While it is able to embed all previously accumulated knowledge regarding useful binary information processing tasks performed by standard CNN's, the pyramidal universal cell provides a broader context for defining other useful processing tasks, including extended gray scale or color image processing as well. Examples of applications in image processing are provided in this paper. Implementation issues are also considered. Assuming some compromise between area and speed, a VLSI implementation of CNN's based on pyramidal cells offers a speedup of up to one million times when compared to corresponding software implementations.

AB  - This article is concerned with the study of analogy and memory as viewed from the perspectives of both artificial intelligence (AI) and psychology. Its aim is to combine what seem to be two distinct and conflicting approaches to memoryâthe functional approach of AI and the empirical approach of psychologyâand propose a unified view that does not compromise the nature of either field yet resolves the existing conflicts between them. To do this we propose a shift away from the narrow view of analogical reminding as an isolated memory behavior and toward a more general view of memory as a process that serves the needs of planning, problem solving, and understanding. This shift involves changes to both the functional arguments that have arisen in AI and a reexamination of the empirical evidence that has been presented in psychology.

AB  - Specific power, power per unit total heat exchanger surface area, of a heat engine is chosen to be the objective function in the design of an OTEC (Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion) Rankine power plant. An ICAI (Intelligent Computer Aided Instruction) computer software, CyclePad, with Refrigerant-12 as the working fluid operating between a warm ocean water heat source and a cold ocean water heat sink is used in the design process. Through manipulation of the boiler pressure and condenser pressure, the specific power of the OTEC plant is calculated and an upper bound is determined. This bound can direct the design of current and future OTEC heat engines to provide beneficial applications in industry. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The potential linkages between artificial intelligence and sociology are growing. This growth is due to importation of artificial intelligence techniques into methodological tools for data analysis, a growing interest among researchers in artificial intelligence in the socially situated agent, and a growing interest among sociologists in using artificial intelligence techniques for theorizing about social phenomena. Increasingly, researchers are addressing concerns of traditional importance within sociology, such as the bases for cooperation, the role of structure in affecting individual agency, and interaction using computational models of intelligent adaptive agents. This article provides an overview of the role that artificial intelligence currently plays within sociology.

N1  - Funding textÂ 2:Â The 1993 austral spring TROVAntarctica experiment was sponsored jointly by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Science Foundation Divi- sion of Polar Programs as part of the Antarctic Space Analog Program, which was created to demonstrate technologies relevant for use in future space exploration inhtarctica. The field experiment had two mutually supportive goals: Technology demonstration-to demonstrate the use of telepresence and virtual reality technology by performing field science in a challenging environment. Scientific exploration-to survey the distribution of benthlc marine organisms in the Antarctic coastal region and characterize the diversity along the depth gradient from 10 to 300 meters. A secondary objective was to collect and chemically analyze selected organisms from a variety of depths.

AB  - At LDS Hospital, we have developed and evaluated a computerized critical value reporting system based on digital pagers. Criteria used to identify critical values are patient-specific. An evaluation of the system was conducted from October 23, 1993 to January 21, 1994. Results showed that 100% of all critical values (497 values in the form of 335 alerts) were reported to clinicians within an average of 38.6 minutes, and that 51% of all alerts were received within 12 minutes. Data also showed that 92% of the alerts were considered valid, that 76% were communicated directly to the primary care nurse, and that 67% of the time nurses were previously unaware of the critical value(s).

AB  - In order to express incomplete knowledge, extended logic programs have been proposed as logic programs with classical negation along with negation as failure. This paper discusses ways to deal with a broad class of common sense knowledge by using extended logic programs. For this purpose, we present a uniform approach for dealing with both incomplete and contradictory programs, as a simple framework of hypothetical reasoning in which some rules are dealt with as candidate hypotheses that can be used to augment the background theory. This theory formation framework can be used for default reasoning, contradiction removals, the closed world assumption, and abduction. We also show a translation of the theory formation framework to an extended logic program whose answer sets correspond to the consistent belief sets of augmented theories. Â© 1994.

AB  - This paper describes a new software approach to the preliminary design of aircraft engine turbines. A hybrid artificial intelligence and numerical-optimization-based design shell called Engineous was used to capture some basic turbine preliminary design knowledge, manipulate turbine design parameters, execute a turbine performance prediction program and its preprocessors, and analyze results. Engineous automatically supplements incomplete human design knowledge with symbolic and numerical search techniques when needed. This approach produced designs with higher predicted performance gains than the existing manual design process in a tenth of the turnaround time and has yielded new insights into turbine design. A comparison of turbine designs obtained by designers and by Engineous is presented here along with an overview of Engineous system architecture. Â© 1992 ASME.

AB  - The method of conjugate gradients is used to expedite the learning process of feedforward multilayer artificial neural networks and to systematically update both the learning parameter and the momentum parameter at each training cycle. The mechanism for the occurrence of premature saturation of the network nodes observed with the backpropagation algorithm is described, suggestions are made to eliminate this undesirable phenomenon, and the reason by which this phenomenon is precluded in the method of conjugate gradients is presented. The proposed method is compared with the standard backpropagation algorithm in the training of neural networks to classify transient events in nuclear power plants simulated by the Midland Nuclear Power Plant Unit 2 simulator. The comparison results indicate that the rate of convergence of the proposed method is much greater than the standard backpropagation, that it reduces both the number of training cycles and the CPU time, and that it is less sensitive to the choice of initial weights. The advantages of the method are more noticeable and important for problems where the network architecture consists of a large number of nodes, the training database is large, and a tight convergence criterion is desired.

AB  - Currently, many workers in the field of medical informatics realize the importance of knowledge reuse. The PROTEGE-II project seeks to develop and implement a domain-independent framework that allows system builders to create custom-tailored role-limiting methods from generic reusable components. These new role-limiting methods are used to create domain- and task-specific knowledge-acquisition tools with which an application expert can generate domain- and task-specific decision-support systems. One required set of reusable components embodies the problem-solving knowledge to generate temporal abstractions. Previously, members of the PROTEGE-II project have used these temporal-abstraction mechanisms to infer the presence of myelotoxicity in patients with AIDS. In this paper, we show that these mechanisms are reusable in the domain of assessment of children's growth.

AB  - This paper describes a project to specify, design, develop, and evaluate a physician's workstation for use in patient care. We conducted an ethnographic study of physicians' information needs in an outpatient setting, from which we derived a set of functional specifications for a physician's workstation. We have implemented an experimental prototype using an open systems, client/server architecture, and are exploring research issues in heterogeneous database integration, object-oriented database technology, model-based reasoning, and semantic integration. We plan to evaluate our workstation prototype in a clinical setting to assess its impact on quality of care and health care costs.

AB  - The performance of many large-scale systems depends on operator skill in manipulating plant information and its flow throughout the system. Advanced concepts in automation offer improvement in information handling which then yields safer operations and increased economic benefits. This paper presents an automatic control system for large-scale systems which integrates recent methods in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and nonlinear control to provide fast and efficient diagnostics and reliable automatic control. The integrated system reduces the procedural load and facilitates the operator tasks by creating a condensed representation of plant status. Operator tasks are emulated by building computer-based algorithms which validate sensor signals, strategies, commands, performance tracking, and which generate reliable decisions, and control actions. The paper presents an application of the integrated control system to the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II). The simulation results show that the advanced concepts yield efficient control strategies including reactor control during startup. Â© 1991 IEEE

AB  - The six-day Remote Agent Experiment (RAX) on the Deep Space 1 mission will be the first time that an artificially intelligent agent will control a NASA spacecraft. Successful completion of this experiment will open the way for AI-based autonomy technology on future missions. An important validation objective for RAX is implementation of a credible validation and verification strategy for RAX that also 'scales up' to missions that make full use of spacecraft autonomy. Autonomous flight software presents novel and difficult testing challenges that traditional flight software (FSW) does not face. Since autonomous software must respond robustly in an immense number of situations, the all-paths testing approaches used for traditional FSW is not feasible. Instead, we advocate a combination of scenario-based testing and model-based validation. This paper describes the testing challenges faced by autonomous spacecraft commanding software, discusses the testing strategies and model-validation methods that we found effective for RAX, and argues that these methods will 'scale up' to missions that make full use of spacecraft autonomy. Among the key challenges for validating autonomous systems such as the RAX are ensuring adequate coverage for scenario-based tests, developing methods for specifying the expected behavior, and developing automated tools for verifying the observed behavior against those specifications. Another challenge, also faced by traditional FSW, is the scarcity of high-fidelity test-beds. The test plan must be designed to take advantage of lower-fidelity test-beds without compromising test effectiveness.

AB  - In order to accurately determine dose equivalent in radiation fields that include both neutrons and photons, it is necessary to measure the relative number of neutrons to photons and to characterize the energy dependence of the neutrons. The relationship between dose and dose equivalent begins to increase rapidly at about 100 keV; thus, it is necessary to separate neutrons from photons for neutron energies as low as about 100 keV in order to measure dose equivalent in a mixed radiation field that includes both neutrons and photons. Preceptron and back propagation neural networks that use pulse amplitude and pulse rise time information obtain separation of neutron and photons with about 5% error for neutrons with energies as low as 100 keV, and this is accomplished for neutrons with energies that range from 100 keV to several MeV. If the ratio of neutrons to photons is changed by a factor of 10, the classification error increases to about 15% for the neural networks tested. A technique that uses the output from the preceptron as a priori for a Bayesian classifier is more robust to changes in the relative number of neutrons to photons, and it obtains a 5% classification error when this ratio is changed by a factor of ten. Results from this research demonstrate that it is feasible to use commercially available instrumentation in combination with artificial intelligence techniques to develop a practical detector that will accurately measure dose equivalent in mixed neutron-photon radiation fields.

AB  - This paper is a survey of current research into computer modeling of buildings. Just as much, however, it is a contribution to a debate on the future of this field of research (and as such expresses the author's opinions, rather than mere facts). It is suggested that more research should be conducted in a top-down "problem-driven" (rather than in a bottom-up, "technology-driven") manner. As a goal of future research, ten desirable system properties are proposed and grouped together under three headings: integration, "intelligence", and compliance. A critical survey of the current state-of-the-art of computer modeling of buildings is given, to assess how far we are from systems with such properties. On that background problems are discussed which are major obstacles to the proposed kind of systems (hence good starting points for "problem-driven research"), and some ways of approaching these problems are briefly evaluated.

AB  - We have built a clinical workstation to help doctors and nurses care for patients with HIV infection. This knowledge-based medical record system provides medication alerts, reminders about primary care, and on-line information to support the care of patients with HIV infection. We are conducting a controlled clinical trial of this computer system in a single practice setting, which consists of 18 staff physicians, 13 nurses, and 113 residents, who cooperatively practice in four teams. Two teams of physicians are assigned to an intervention group and two teams to a control group. This paper reports preliminary results from the first year of study, January 15, 1992, through January 14, 1993. During this period 274 patients with HIV infection were followed by the general medical practice--130 in a control group and 144 in an intervention group. Physicians in the intervention group more rapidly and more completely followed primary care guidelines than did physicians in the control group. Patients in the intervention group had 2476 ambulatory or emergency visits (17.2 visits per patient) compared with 1882 visits (14.5 visits per patient) for the control patients (p < 0.01). There were 101 hospitalizations for 51 patients in the intervention group (an admission rate of 0.7) compared with 104 admissions for 54 patients in the control group (an admission rate of 0.8) (p = NS). There were 8 deaths in the intervention group (5.6%) compared with 13 (10%) in the control group (p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - The manual design of the underground electrical supply system for new residential developments (electrical plat design) results often in an overdesigned, costly and nonstandardized solution. The Intelligent Decision Support System for Automated Electrical Plat Design (IDSS for AEPD) is an engineering tool aimed at automating electrical plat design. This tool, currently under development at Puget Power and the University of Washington, combines the spatial analysis capabilities of a Geographic Information System (GIS) with the sophistication of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deal with the complexity inherent in this type of problem. This paper presents the results of the AEPD prototype implementation and feasibility evaluation of the AEPD concept. The development of the AEPD tool concept is presented in companion paper [2].

AB  - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is one of the most successful new paradigms to make large and complex software systems feasible. It has already been used in several experimental tools for digital signal processing (DSP). This paper presents an overview of the object-oriented methodology in general and the ways it may be applied to integrate DSP software. Examples are given on how the approach is used to solve signal processing problems in the QuickSig system, developed at the Helsinki University of Technology. The most important existing OOP languages and programming environments are discussed and compared from the point of view of DSP research and development. It should become clear that OOP is a proper methodology for DSP programming and much further work is needed to find the best tools and ways to build highly advanced programming environments.

AB  - Some cognitive scientists have asserted that cognitive processing is not well modeled by classical notions of representation and process that have dominated psychology and artificial intelligence since the cognitive revolution. In response to this claim, the concept of a mediating state is developed. Mediating states are the class of information-carrying internal states used by cognitive systems, and as such are accepted even by those researchers who reject representations. The debate over representation, then, is actually one about what additional properties of mediating states are necessary for explaining cognitive processing. Five properties that can be added to mediating states are examined for their importance in cognitive models.

AB  - &: Conclusions -This paper presents a model for throughput-improvement in stochastic networks. It synthesizes & extends the: state-of-knowledge on determining the mean value, the lower bound (LB). and upper bound (UB) for the maximum-flow network-design problem. Through the use of an artificial-intelligence programming-language such as PROLOG, the LB was solved very efficiently the first time. The key lies in using 'depth-first search' to generate the flow paths, which are then direct!}' fed into a linear programming (LP) or mixed-integer mathematical programming (MIP) package for solution. The largest network solved consists of 70 nodes and 116 arcs, surpassing other computational experience reported in the literature. In all test cases, the: solutions were validated from the prescriptive model against a descriptive model. This is particularly insightful for the 3 case-studies of defense communication networks, where estimates from simulation were used as a reference for comparison against the mathematical-programming results. The simulation-derived response-surface models validate not only the LB & UB, but the network-improvement strategies. In a complementary fashion, simulation serves as the approximate solution to an exact problem, while the LP or MIP seek the exact solution to an approximate problem (at a tiny fraction of computation time). Theoretical findings are verified on 7 experiments, which represent the largest data-set analyzed (to the best of our knowledge). This includes measures of approximation-error and of network vulnerability & reliability -key components of mean throughput. Sensitivity analysis, which is inherent in the LP or MIP formulations, also yields consistent results with controlled experiments using simulation models. In all networks, the LB solution in this paper is a better approximation to the exact solution than the UB, which is consistent with theoretical findings. This finding is important in that the 7 acyclic networks represent a diversity of geometry and of survival probabilities. Another advantage of using the LB model and the path-enumeration solution-strategy has to do with an approximation of network reliability & vulnerability in that these approximate measures of performance are readily available from the solutions. Built upon the idea of most-probable states, reliability UB and vulnerability are related to the paths actually used. The paths used are but a small fraction of the paths generated, and the number of generated paths is again tiny compared to the 2" probability states (n = number of arcs & nodes). A minute fraction of the total number of failure states accounts for most of the state space - a fact that is further reinforced by the prevalence of a zerothroughput state in the flow distributions.

AB  - Techniques in both operations research (OR) and artificial intelligence (AI) have been demonstrated to be useful in certain scheduling problems. Some of the better known scheduling techniques developed in OR are linear programming (LP), branch-and-bound (BB) and tabu search. In AI, better known scheduling techniques are hill climbing (HC), simulated annealing (SA), constraint satisfaction (CS), genetic algorithms (GAs), connectionist methods and expert systems (ES). Given that different techniques have different natures, it is reasonable to believe that they have different domains in which they are effective. A major obstacle which prevents problem solvers (people who have real problems to solve) from applying these techniques to scheduling is the difficulty in knowing when to apply which technique. It is argued that expertise in 'which technique to apply when' is at least as important as expertise in the individual techniques, if not more so. This paper summarises and contrasts some of the better known OR and AI techniques for scheduling, and, based on their nature, suggests guidelines for problem solvers in choosing between them.

AB  - This paper presents the basic framework of an intelligent planning environment for automated dimensional inspection. The goal is to develop a decision planner that can directly interpret the design data provided in the AD product model and generate inspection procedures. A prototype has been reported to show how to extract the necessary information from a geometric model, generate a data structure for inspection planning, and search for economic inspection sequences.

AB  - The inability of many clinical decision-support applications to integrate with existing databases limits the wide-scale deployment of such systems. To overcome this obstacle, we have designed a data-interpretation module that can be embedded in a general architecture for protocol-based reasoning and that can support the fundamental task of detecting temporal abstractions. We have developed this software module by coupling two existing systems--RESUME and Chronus--that provide complementary temporal-abstraction techniques at the application and the database levels, respectively. Their encapsulation into a single module thus can resolve the temporal queries of protocol planners with the domain-specific knowledge needed for the temporal-abstraction task and with primary time-stamped data stored in autonomous clinical databases. We show that other computer methods for the detection of temporal abstractions do not scale up to the data- and knowledge-intensive environments of protocol-based decision-support systems.

AB  - In this paper, we describe an expert system for dynamic security assessment (DSA) in which artificial intelligence techniques are applied to the Transient Energy Function (TEF) method. The effect of contingencies on the security level and its rate of change with changing system conditions and parameters are computed using the results of the TEF sensitivity analysis program. The expert system determines the loading trend and analyzes the data obtained from TEF to compute the trend of the security index. The trend of the control parameters can then be adjusted to maintain the security index within a range of safe values. An example is given using data collected from the Northern States Power Company (NSP) where the expert system correctly computed the security index and suggested adjustments to system parameters.

AB  - Current research in the area of nonmonotonic reasoning suggests that autoepistemic logic provides a general framework for formalizing commonsense reasoning in various domains of discourse. The goal of this paper is to investigate the suitability of autoepistemic logic for formalization of some forms of inheritance reasoning. To this end we propose a new semantics for inheritance networks with exceptions based on autoepistemic logic.

AB  - This paper presents a study of the feasibility of using artificial neural networks (ANNs) in transient stability assessment for power systems. In the study ANNs have been developed to synthesize the complex mapping that carries the power system operating variables and fault locations into the Critical Clearing Times. The training of the ANNs was achieved through the method of backpropagation. The critical fault clearing time values were obtained by the Extended Equal Area Criterion method and used for training. In this work, an attempt was made to avoid the restrictions on load and topology variations. The parameters of the ANNs consist of the generation and loading levels. None of these inputs require any computation. This feature is desirable for on-line transient stability assessment purposes. Training of the ANNs was achieved using a combined production learning phase. The training patterns were not limited to a given collection of samples. This scheme eliminates the problem that an ANN may be influenced by the regions of attraction of a specific category. Â© 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.

AB  - The major work on the theory and application of artificial intelligence (Al), which includes expert systems, is going on in the United States, Europe and Japan. The Japanese electric utility industry, manufacturers, universities and the government have taken a focused goal-oriented approach in this regard. The author has studied the Japanese involvement in this field and visited eight Japanese R&D laboratories, where he discussed the Al and expert system related activities (in the power industry). This paper provides a comprehensive look at the combined Japanese effort. The current topics of interest are: (i) Al and its application in power engineering; (ii) problems in Al applications development and their solutions; (iii) practical system examples; and (iv) Al applications to power systems of the future. Out of the 97 papers cited in this paper, 10 were produced by electric utilities, 10 by manufacturers, 17 by universities and 60 were joint efforts. This shows the level and importance of joint collaborative research among the Japanese researchers. Even though they are working on many theorectical aspects of the Al technology including automated knowledge acquisition and verification, they still use significant amount of theoretical work done in the United States for successful prototyping of Al based tools. It is, however, safe to say that the use of Al tools in the Japanese electric power industry is far more widespread than what is seen in the United States or in Europe. Â© 1993 IEEE

AB  - It is expected that future design/manufacturing systems should be autonomous, metamorphological, self-organizing, self-maintaining/recovering, and intelligent. To develop such systems, the concept of knowledge intensiveness plays a crucial role. Developing knowledge intensive systems requires building large scale knowledge bases on manufacturing and design. Our experiences with developing a large scale design knowledge base for intelligent CAD systems show, however, that without systematizing design knowledge it is impossible even just to collect knowledge. This paper discusses aims, goals, and roles of design knowledge systematization and proposes a systematization methodology. Some preliminary results are also described. Â© 1993 CIRP.

AB  - We show how the transferable belief model (TBM) can be used to assess and to combine expert opinions. The transferable belief model has the advantage that it can handle weighted opinions and their aggregation without the introduction of any ad hoc methods. We also study a paradigm in reliability analysis. It shows that the TBM analysis leads to a solution diametrically opposed to the Bayesian solution. Â© 1992.

N1  - Funding textÂ 1:Â So the odds decrease in the Bayesian analysis, and increase in the TBM analysis. Which fits common sense? The good sensor says TC, both bad sensors say TH. Bayesians conclude that TH is supported by the data. The TBM concludes that TC is supported by the data.

AB  - A debate of the merits of human space travel as opposed to robots is presented. While robotic space travel would be considerably less expensive, the author takes the position that there are certain skills and research abilities that only humans possess. Human contributions to past lunar exploration are considered, along with a discussion of the interaction of humans with robotics or other artificial intelligence or computer driven technologies. The author concludes that while robots and machines are tools which should be incorporated into space travel, they are not adequate substitutes for people.

AB  - Significant advances have been achieved in model-based reasoning in the past decade, rendering it one of the most active branches of artificial intelligence. Research on model-based reasoning focuses on two major goals: being able to predict and explain device behavior, mostly using qualitative representations. Viewed from the same perspective, many research issues in biomedicine share the same outlook: being able to predict the behavior of a certain biological system, and being able to explain why the system behaves as it does (or will behave as it is predicted to). Qualitative modeling, with its wide margins for ambiguity, provides an excellent toolset for the simulation of biological systems which do not lend themselves easily to mathematical modeling. This article presents a review of recent advances in model-based reasoning in biomedicine.

AB  - A brief review of the process planning literature is provided. One of the basic issues in process planning is the feature recognition. In the paper rather than representing a part with features, the representation using machinable volumes is emphasized. A model for the selection of machinable volumes with minimum corresponding machining costs, fixture and tool utilization costs is formulated. The model is illustrated with a numerical example. Computational results for five existing parts are presented. Â© 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The etiologies of dental fear and dental behavior management problems in children were investigated in a database of information on 2,257 Swedish children 4-6 and 9-11 years old. The analyses were performed using computerized inductive techniques within the field of artificial intelligence. The database held information regarding dental fear levels and behavior management problems, which were defined as outcomes, i.e. dependent variables. The attributes, i.e. independent variables, included data on dental health and dental treatments, information about parental dental fear, general anxiety, socioeconomic variables, etc. The data contained both numerical and discrete variables. The analyses were performed using an inductive analysis program (XpertRule Analyser(R), Attar Software Ltd, Lancashire, UK) that presents the results in a hierarchic diagram called a knowledge tree. The importance of the different attributes is represented by their position in this diagram. The results show that inductive methods are well suited for analyzing multifactorial and complex relationships in large data sets, and are thus a useful complement to multivariate statistical techniques. The knowledge trees for the two outcomes, dental fear and behavior management problems, were very different from each other, suggesting that the two phenomena are not equivalent. Dental fear was found to be more related to non-dental variables, whereas dental behavior management problems seemed connected to dental variables.

AB  - A current assessment of the "philosophy" of instructional technology is made using a 1970 BJET article as the basis of comparison. Each hypothesis of the original article is revisited and updated according to contemporary trends: (1) instructional technology is not yet a discipline; (2) the behavioural science concept of instructional technology is more valid than the physical science concept; (3) technology offers the best organizing concept for the development of the field and its evolution into a discipline; and (4) any statement of philosophy regarding instructional technology is tentative. The influence of distance education, public acceptance of media and technology, and training by artificial intelligence procedures in business and industry are nominated as important factors in bringing about major changes in the field. Each professional should develop a unique philosophy based on personal experiences in the field.

AB  - Fuzzy-logic controllers (FLCs) have been shown to be very promising in controlling illmodeled and complicated systems. Moreover, they offer an alternative to more traditional robot control schemes, and this alternative can be more readily integrated with the artificial intelligence required for task planning and decision making, both crucial to robotics. However, the traditional methods of designing FLCs are based on expert heuristic knowledge and trial and error, and are often tedious and unyielding. In this article, we develop a computer-implemented procedure for designing a hierarchical hybrid fuzzy-PID (HHFPID) controller for the position and trajectory control of a two-link robotic arm. This procedure combines genetic algorithms (GAs), expert knowledge, and fuzzy learning from examples. We will discuss the computational issues of our approach, and the design of fitness functions and encoding schemes required by the genetic algorithms. Based on extensive simulation studies, we conclude that the GA-designed controller has a satisfactory and sometimes superior performance. Â© 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - This article describes the theoretical underpinnings that preceded the design of a new neonatal pulse oximeter alarm that differentiates true from false alarms based on an artificial intelligence theory called "fuzzy logic." The connection between the intuition and sense of advocacy gained through neonatal primary nursing and the application of fuzzy logic to solve the problem of false alarms--that is, the symbiosis between nurse and machine--are explained. Emphasis is placed throughout on the importance of involving nurses in the development of the technology for which they are responsible.

AB  - An artificial neural network-based procedure for predicting empennage buffeting pressures and elastic response as a function of upstream flowfield and geometric conditions has been developed under a cooperative experimental and analytical research agreement between McDonnell Douglas Aerospace (MDA) and NASA Langley Research Center. This research program is a continuing MDA effort to develop a unified buffet design methodology. The current effort employs a hybrid cascading neural network and finite element modeling method to predict flexible tail response based on rigid test pressure information. This method is dependent on experimental data to train the neural network algorithms, but is robust enough to expand its knowledge base with additional aircraft data. Initial results show an incredible potential to predict accurate rms and frequencydependent tail pressures, as well as flexible response while providing the future capability to incorporate upstream computational fluid dynamics data for advanced design aircraft buffet pressure predictions.

AB  - It has been more than a decade since the first intelligent scheduling system ISIS was reported. Numerous intelligent scheduling systems have been developed since then, in the USA and in Europe, new search techniques have been invented, new theoretical results are emerging, and scheduling applications have been developed from general-purpose toolkits. This paper summarises achievements in intelligent scheduling over the decade and takes a brief look forward.

AB  - The fatigue life of dynamic helicopter components is highly dependent on the history of loads experienced by the components during flight. However, practical methods of monitoring the loads on individual components during flight have not been developed. Current maintenance programs are characterized by frequent inspections and sometimes premature retirement of safety-critical components. This paper proposes using an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the loads in critical components based on flight variable information that can be easily measured. The artificial neural network learns the relationship between flight variables and component loads through exposure to a database of flight variable records and corresponding load histories taken from ah instrumented military helicopter undergoing standard maneuvers. Eight standard flight variables are used as inputs for predicting the time-varying mean and oscillatory components of the tailboom bending load and the pitch link load for seven flight maneuvers. The ANN predicts the mean and oscillatory components with accuracy ranging from 90.7% to 97.7% correct. Â© 1994 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.

AB  - Sharing and reuse of knowledge bases is recognized in Artificial Intelligence and Medical Informatics as beneficial, but difficult. Reusing an existing knowledge base can save considerable time and effort during the knowledge engineering phase, and facilitates integration of systems. However, the degree to which knowledge can be shared among different applications is still mainly an empirical question. In this paper, we describe the preliminary results of our attempt to reuse the UMLS Semantic Network as an ontology for the knowledge base of a patient education system.

AB  - This paper presents techniques for identifying coherent generators using artificial neural networks. The proposed method is used to identify three types of equivalents, parochial, local and global. Identification is based on the adaptive pattern recognition concept and four features which are considered to be central to the phenomenon of coherency. An algorithm based on an algebraic characterization of global equivalents using an inertially weighted synchronizing torque matrix is proposed. The method is applied to the well-known 39-bus New England system, taken as a test example. Â© 1992.

AB  - Real-time route guidance is a promising approach to alleviating congestion on the nation's highways. A dynamic traffic assignment model is central to the development of guidance strategies. The artificial intelligence technique of genetic algorithms (GAs) is used to solve a dynamic traffic assignment model developed for a real-world routing scenario in Hampton Roads, Virginia. The results of the GA approach are presented and discussed, and the performance of the GA program is compared with an example of commercially available nonlinear programming (NLP) software. Among the main conclusions is that GAs offer tangible advantages when used to solve the dynamic traffic assignment problem. First, GAs allow the relaxation of many of the assumptions that were needed to solve the problem analytically by traditional techniques. GAs can also handle larger problems than some of the commercially available NLP software packages.

AB  - We have used crosswell seismic data and an artificial neural network to predict interwell reservoir properties in the Sulimar Queen field. In this study, we first predict the gamma ray response between two wells where the crosswell seismic was shot. The gamma ray response is predicted between the wells by training an artificial neural network with actual gamma ray logs available at the wells and the interwell seismic data. Using the a priori information that the porosity is well correlated with the gamma ray response, we estimate the interwell porosity distribution.

AB  - This paper discusses how a group leader computer tutor may aid students in learning collaborative skills in a co-operative learning environment. However, students need to learn collaborative skills and practice using them. The group leader computer tutor discussed in this paper is designed on the principles of co-operative learning, intelligent tutoring systems and computer-supported collaborative work within an intelligent collaborative learning system (ICLS). The group leader aims to facilitate group work on the task level and to teach students how to use collaborative skills in the discussion level as students work on networked computers in the Jigsaw method of co-operative learning. The ICLS and its group leader were used by two classes at a liberal arts university. Qualitative research shows that the students' co-operative attitudes changed and academic achievement improved from pre- to post-treatment. Students, especially, used the communication skill of openness in comment type discussions. The students enjoyed working collaboratively through the ICLS and their teachers thought that the experience was valuable for them. Â© 1996 Chapman & Hall.

AB  - This article reviews nine different cognitive conceptions of expertise: (a) a general-process view, (b) a quantity of knowledge view, (c) an organization of knowledge view, (d) an analytical-ability view, (e) a creative-ability view, (f) an automaticity view, (g) a practical-ability view, and (h) a labeling view. The article then proposes a ninth synthetic view, according to which expertise is a prototypical concept, and the person is more expert to the extent that he or she possesses more of these eight qualities.

AB  - We prove that the hybrid cooperating distributed (CD) grammar systems with four components can generate non-ET0L languages, thus solving a problem left open in the grammar systems literature. Then we investigate the conditions under which the hybrid systems can generate non-context-free languages. A precise description (characterization) of such systems is given. The comparison with the family of matrix languages is also approached. Several open problems are formulated.

AB  - Tolerance is an important aspect in comparing alternative designs and manufacturing processes. This paper presents a brief review of the previous work in the area of tolerance as it relates to manufacturing strategies and technologies. In addition, models for the economic selection of part tolerance that consider reworking are developed. The models can be helpful in augmenting some of the current artificial intelligence modules and expert systems to improve their performance. Â© 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We have developed a general method that solves the task of creating abstract, interval-based concepts from time-stamped clinical data. We refer to this method as knowledge-based temporal-abstraction (KBTA). In this paper, we focus on the knowledge representation, acquisition, maintenance, reuse and sharing aspects of the KBTA method. We describe five problem-solving mechanisms that solve the five subtasks into which the KBTA method decomposes its task, and four types of knowledge necessary for instantiating these mechanisms in a particular domain. We present an example of instantiating the KBTA method in the clinical area of monitoring insulin-dependent-diabetes patients.

AB  - Cell control forms an important layer in a hierarchy of control. A cell will typically contain several machine tools, robots and allied material handling equipment. The function of a cell controller is to co-ordinate and control the equipment within the cell so as to achieve high degrees of efficiency. A requirement is that the cell controller should function in real-time. The need to maintain high cell efficiency while having relatively low computation times poses a severe requirement on the design of a cell controller. Previous cell controller predominantly either suffer from relatively long computation times or else handle only a portion of the cell control functions. The aim of this paper is to give a detailed description of the operation of X-Cell, a cell control system that uses object-oriented programming to map cell control functions onto objects. The language used is Scheme, with Scheme Object Oriented Programming System (SCOOPS) providing the object-oriented paradigm. The paper gives a brief overview of the architecture of X-Cell, together with a more detailed description of each of the three main modules: the scheduler, operation dispatcher, and monitor. A brief description of the X-Cell emulator is then given. Finally, an example scenario using X-Cell is given. The overall result is a cell control system that can be adapted for use in a wide variety of manufacturing cells. Â© 1992.

AB  - A method is presented where medical knowledge modules, written in the Arden Syntax, are used in a decision-support system (DSS). Knowledge modules are, after syntax-checking, translated into the object oriented programming language C++, compiled and linked to the DSS. The object oriented approach together with developed tools, such as knowledge editor and translator, makes it possible to implement the Arden Syntax and to get an efficient, easy-maintained DSS. Work on a prototype shows that this approach has several advantages when building a DSS where medical knowledge is represented in the Arden Syntax.

AB  - This paper gives an overview of research on the non-destructive testing of wood byultrasonics. The main topic of the paper is how ultrasonics may be used to characterize defects in logs and how to develop a way to scan logs in sawmill production. By combining ultrasonics with artificial intelligence, defects can be characterized by a scheme of wavepattern recognition and a procedure of total information reasoning. The newly developed method seems to improve scanning efficiency. The result of defect characterization of a cross-section is found to agree with the result obtained by X-ray tomography.

AB  - During a power system disturbance, an Energy Management System can present an overwhelming number of alarms to the power system operators within a short period of time. This leads to operator confusion and makes problem analysis difficult. A knowledge-based alarm processing system which incorporates the expertise of experienced power system operators can use the knowledge to present meaningful, concise diagnostic messages to the operators. The knowledge-based system reduces the number of alarms that the operators must view and comprehend. It also diagnoses the current situation on the power system. The concise messages allow the operators to quickly Isolate and minimize the effects of the disturbance so that the power system may be restored as rapidly as possible. This paper presents a novel station oriented knowledge-based alarm processor prototype that has been developed for the Wisconsin Electric Power Company SCADA system. The knowledge-based system accesses a configuration database that contains information on both the topology of the power system as well as symbolic data values. Forward chaining rules are used to form hypotheses when state changes occur on the power system. Backward chaining rules then attempt to prove each hypothesis using the current facts and the configuration database. Metalevel control rules improve system performance by selecting goals and doing context switching during the Inference process. A rule-based management system is also Introduced. The knowledge-based system continuously analyzes and processes SCADA alarms In real-time, presenting diagnostic messages to the power system operators without requiring any information from the operators. The prototype, written in the C Programming Language, resides on a standalone computer with a data Interface to the SCADA system. Â© 1990 IEEE

AB  - Although the job shop scheduling (JSS) problem is of eminent practical importance and has received considerable attention by both industry and academia, because of its complexity, it still remains an enigma. Artificial Intelligence holds the potential for providing solutions to complex problems, such as the JSS problem. However, due to the magnitude of the JSS problem, search techniques are not computationally feasible. Expert Systems, though, have been successfully applied to problems of this type. The development of an expert system, however, implies the availability of an expert. Regrettably, such experts are not readily available in the JSS environment. The approach presented in this paper involves the use of computer simulation models of a job shop to train subjects so that they are capable of effective scheduling, and then extracting the knowledge of these "experts" to develop an expert system.

AB  - This paper discusses the Issues which must be addressed when integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, in particular, expert system applications in an Energy Management System (EMS) environment. It is argued that these issues can be resolved by creating an environment which supports all the interfaces between the Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications and the EMS. This environment should also be responsible for maintaining a model of the power system common to all the AI applications. Once this environment has been created, AI applications can be easily "plugged" into the EMS. The design of snch an environment is described and case studies of its implementation are provided to illustrate its flexibility. Â© 1995 IEEE.

AB  - In many textbook solutions, for systems failure diagnosis problems studied using reliability theory and artificial intelligence, the prior probabilities of different failure states can be estimated and used to guide the sequential search for failed components after the whole system fails. In practice, however, both the component failure probabilities and the structure function of the system being examined - i.e., the mapping between the states of its components and the state of the system - may not be known with certainty. At best, the probabilities of different hypothesized system descriptions, each specifying the component failure probabilities and the system's structure function, may be known to a useful approximation, perhaps based on sample data and previous experience. Cost-effective diagnosis of the system's failure state is then a challenging problem. Although the probabilities of component failures are aleatory, uncertainties about these probabilities and about the system structure function are epistemic. This paper examines how to make best use of both epistemic prior probabilities for system descriptions and the information gleaned from costly inspections of component states after the system fails, to minimize the average cost of identifying the failure state. Two approaches are introduced for systems dominated by aleatory uncertainties, one motivated by information theory and the other based on the idea of trying to prove a hypothesis about the identity of the failure state as efficiently as possible. While the general problem of cost-effective failure diagnosis is computationally intractable (NP-hard), both heuristics provide useful approximations on small to moderate sized problems and optimal results for certain common types of reliability systems, including series, parallel, parallel-series, and k-out-of-n systems. A hybrid heuristic that adaptively chooses which heuristic to apply next after any sequence of observations (component test results) appears to give excellent results. Several computational experiments are summarized in support of these conclusions, and extensions to reliability systems with repair are briefly considered. Next, it is shown that diagnosis can proceed when aleatory and epistemic uncertainties are both present using the same techniques developed for aleatory probabilities alone. If only the epistemic probability distribution of system descriptions is known, then the same heuristics that are used to diagnose a system's failure state for systems with known descriptions can also be used to identify the system and diagnose its failure state when there is epistemic uncertainty about the identity of the system. This result suggests a unified approach to least-cost failure diagnosis in reliability systems with both aleatory probabilities of component failures and epistemic probabilities for system descriptions.

AB  - Truth maintenance is considered to be an area of AI concerned with revisiting sets of beliefs and 'maintaining the truth in the system' when new information contradicts existing information. This system works with interference engines acting as problem solvers within large search spaces. The application of TMSs are numerous but in the present study only two are accounted; constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and scenario and planning problems.

AB  - A prototype software tool integrating knowledge-base and database approaches is developed to solve lighting-retrofit problems for energy conservation and management purposes. Founded on the types of problems and the conceptual differences between conventional programming and knowledge-based expert systems, it is felt that a system which combines both approaches is best for solving lighting-retrofit problems. The architecture of the system is built on the concept of knowledge-based expert systems and its links to a database. A commercially available knowledge-engineering tool and a dBase III-compatible complier are used for system development. Improvements necessary to upgrade the current research system into a deliverable tool are suggested. Â© 1993.

AB  - Linking a knowledge-based system (KBS) to a clinical database is a difficult task, but critical if such systems are to achieve widespread use. The Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center's clinical event monitor provides alerts, interpretations, research screening, and quality assurance functions for the center. Its knowledge base consists of Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules (MLMs). The knowledge base was analyzed in order to quantify the use and impact of KBS-database links. The MLM data slot, which contains the definition of these links, had almost as many statements (5.8 vs. 8.8, ns with p = 0.15) and more tokens (122 vs. 76, p = 0.037) than the logic slot, which contains the actual medical knowledge. The data slot underwent about twice as many modifications over time as the logic slot (3.0 vs. 1.6 modifications/version, p = 0.010). Database queries and updates accounted for 97.2% of the MLM's total elapsed execution time. Thus, KBS-database links consume substantial resources in an MLM knowledge base, in terms of coding, maintenance, and performance.

AB  - This paper describes an application of symbolic computation in robotics education. A software package is presented which combines generality, user interaction, and user-friendliness with the systematic usage of symbolic computation and artificial intelligence techniques. The software utilizes MACSYMA, a LISP-based symbolic algebra language, to generate automatically closed-form expressions representing forward and inverse kinematics solutions, the Jacobian transformation matrices, robot pose error compensation models equations, and Lagrange dynamics formulation for N degree-of-freedom, open chain robotic manipulators. The goal of such a package is to aid faculty and students in the robotics course by removing burdensome tasks of mathematical manipulations. The software package has been successfully tested for its accuracy using commercially available robots. Â© 1992 IEEE

AB  - This paper presents a new approach of out-of-step relaying based on fuzzy classification. The proposed scheme is equipped with one transducer which is fed by local measurements. The out-of-step relay is designed by selecting the appropriate features, partitioning the pattern space into fuzzy subspaces and inducing a fuzzy if-then rule for each subspace by applying the training set. Then, the designed relay is tested through numerical simulation for a typical study system. Compared to other artificial intelligence (AI)-based schemes, the developed scheme exhibits simpler design, faster on-line operation and better reliability. Â© 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

AB  - We have developed an approach to medical knowledge representation whereby simple medical concepts are combined to yield complex statements of testable medical logic. The logic is created from a small number of generic medical concepts that are instantiated and combined to create the rules. Rule writing is done through a rule editor and requires knowledge of the system's data dictionaries, though no programming is required. We have used the approach to create a large knowledge base including panic lab alerting rules, drug-laboratory interaction alerting rules, an adverse drug event monitor, and a drug-age interaction detection program. The rules have been used as part of an alerting system and for data collection to determine the frequency of events of interest. The scheme is extensible and yields a readable form of the created knowledge. The scheme holds great promise as a durable form of medical knowledge representation.

AB  - The U.S. Naval Academy has assembled a laboratory consisting of 16 identical stations in support of several robotics and machine vision courses. Each station has an 80386-based microcomputer, a five degree-of-freedom robot arm, a video-rate vision system, and a speech synthesis system. The robot arms are capable of teach-pendant operation or control via the attached computer. Programs written in the robot control language can be downloaded into, stored in, and run from robot RAM. For greater flexibility, move instructions can be generated by the controlling computer (in any desired computer language) and transmitted to the arm for execution via an RS-232 link. Each joint of the robot (plus the gripper) has a dedicated microprocessor for closed-loop servo operation utilizing incremental drive-motor shaft encoders and micro-switches for âhome" locations. The vision system includes an RS170-compatible video camera, a PC-compatible frame grabber board, and a video monitor. This configuration permits the utilization of 2D and 3D vision feedback in the robot control process. The laboratory is used in support of undergraduate courses that cover such topics as robot kinematics and task planning, elementary machine vision, and artificial neural networks.

AB  - Hospital-acquired infections are responsible for an increase in patient mortality and costs. Their detection is essential to permit better infection control. We developed an expert system specifically to detect infections in pediatric patients. The expert system is implemented at LDS Hospital that has a level three newborn intensive care unit and well baby units. We describe how the knowledge base of the expert system was developed, implemented, and validated in a retrospective study. The results of the system were compared to manual reviewer results. The expert system had a sensitivity of 84.5% and specificity of 92.8% in detecting hospital-acquired infections when compared to a physician reviewer. The Cohen's kappa between the expert system and the physician reviewer was 0.62 (p < .001).

AB  - A single-lane advanced vehicle-highway concept that can increase driving comfort and highway capacity is proposed. The concept can be implemented in the near future as it uses the adaptive cruise control (ACC) technology on vehicles and the intelligent ramp metering technologies on the roadway. A simulation-based performance evaluation of single-lane ACC systems under different traffic conditions is presented. The results indicate that drivers can fully use ACC systems even in stop-and-go-traffic, thereby reducing driving stress. It is also shown that ACC-equipped vehicles can maintain a desired intervehicle gap of 1 s under different traffic conditions while attenuating traffic disturbances, thereby resulting in a traffic flow of up to 3,000 vehicles per hour per lane with properly designed intelligent ramp metering at entrances to such a highway.

AB  - Three different modeling approaches were applied to explain truck accidents at interchanges in Washington State during a 27-month period. Three models were developed for each ramp type including linear regression, neural networks, and a hybrid system using fuzzy logic and neural networks. The study showed that the linear regression was able to predict accident frequencies that fell within one standard deviation from the overall mean of the dependent variable. However, the coefficient of determination was very low in all cases. The other two artificial intelligence (AI) approaches showed a high level of performance in identifying different patterns of accidents in the training data and presented a better fit when compared to the regression model. However, the ability of these AI models to predict test data that were not included in the training process showed unsatisfactory results.

AB  - We treat infrared patterns of absorption or emission by nerve and blister agent compounds (and simulants of this chemical group) as features for the training of neural networks to detect the compoundsâ liquid layers on the ground or their vapor plumes during evaporation by external heating. Training of a four-layer network architecture is composed of a backward-error-propagation algorithm and a gradient-descent paradigm. We conduct testing by feed-forwarding preprocessed spectra through the network in a scaled format consistent with the structure of the training-data-set representation. The best-performance weight matrix (spectral filter) evolved from final network training and testing with software simulation trials is electronically transferred to a set of eight artificial intelligence integrated circuits (ICsâ) in specific modular form (splitting of weight matrices). This form makes full use of all inputâoutput IC nodes. This neural network computer serves an important real-time detection function when it is integrated into pre- and postprocessing data-handling units of a tactical prototype thermoluminescence sensor now under development at the Edgewood Research, Development, and Engineering Center.

AB  - Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) are used worldwide for the production of parts in CIM systems. The design and operation of an FMS can be achieved only by the teamwork of several experts using different computer programs. Because of the complexity and diversity of the problems to be solved, traditional programming can be used only if combined with artificial intelligence techniques, such as expert and knowledge-based systems. This paper deals with the application of expert systems to assist in quality control and the simulation and control of FMSs. Well known traditional simulation (Cinema/SIMAN) and networking (MAP) packages are combined with high performance expert systems (ALL-EX, G2) to provide acceptable solutions. This paper reports on recent work where rapid prototype rograms are under test, with the ultimate goal of providing industrially applicable programs. Â© 1994.

AB  - The modelling and identification of non-linear dynamical systems are considered in this paper. The emulation of an existing controller, a skilled human for example, is a special case of this general treatment. A technique is sought, capable of developing general black-box non-linear models with both numerical and symbolic data. The models themselves are expressed in a high-level human-understandable format and are induced from examples of past behaviour. In the case of human controllers, this approach removes reliance on the articulation of skilled behaviour. The studied approach is based on the automatic induction of decision trees and production rules from examples; these are particular cases of classifiers. The algorithms used are a product of the machine learning sub-field of artificial intelligence research. A formalism is developed whereby the modelling and control of general dynamical systems are transformed to classification problems, and therefore become amenable to processing by the induction algorithms mentioned above. Experimental results are presented describing the induction of executable models, both of skilled human control behaviour and of an existing automatic controller. Experiments were performed in simulations and on physical laboratory apparatus.

AB  - A good model is essential in simulating and analyzing a system satisfactorily. This paper proposes a new computer-aided modelling methodology to construct parsimonious models for dynamic physical systems. A set of domain-independent modelling principles and domain-dependent modelling constraints has been formulated to guide parsimonious model construction. Models and the knowledge base for the enhancement of models have been described by bond graphs. After a parsimonious model is generated, two types of qualitative analysis are conducted; one is to derive unknown states from known states and the other is to predict the effects of parameter changes on the whole system. This methodology is only applicable when the structure of a dynamic system is known beforehand. A detailed case study is presented to demonstrate this approach.

AB  - In this paper a combination of Hopfield-Tank type and Chua-Lin type artificial neural networks is applied to solve simultaneously the unit commitment and the associated economic unit dispatch problems. The approach is based on imbedding the various economic and electrical constraints of the unit commitment and dispatch problems in a generalized energy function, and then defining the network dynamics in such a way that the generalized energy function is a Lyapunov function of the artificial neural network. The novel feature of the proposed approach is that the non-linear programming problem for unit dispatch and the combinatorial optimization problem for unit commitment are solved simultaneously by one network. The method is illustrated by an example. Â© 1993.

AB  - The control of batch manufacturing systems is complex, and one viable solution is to break control into a series of levels within an overall hierarchy of control. Cell control forms a major element of such a hierarchy in that cell controllers manage and co-ordinate the manufacturing equipment within each cell. This equipment includes robots, machine tools and material handling systems. This paper reviews object oriented programming, and describes its use in a cell control system termed X-cell. Object-oriented programming has advantages in terms of a modular programming style, an increased flexibility and easier maintainability. An overview of X-Cell is given. Three main modules are used: the scheduler, the operation dispatcher, and the monitor. Each uses a number of objects. The use of object-oriented programming results in flexibility in handling a wide range of factors. Â© 1991.

AB  - We investigate possible belief sets of an agent reasoning with default rules. Besides of Reiter's extensions which are based on a proof-theoretic paradigm (similar to Logic Programming), other structures for default theories, based on weaker or different methods of constructing belief sets are considered, in particular, weak extensions and minimal sets. The first of these concepts is known to be closely connected to autoepistemic expansions of Moore, the other to minimal stable autoepistemic theories containing the initial assumptions. We introduce the concept of stratified collection of default rules and investigate the properties of the largest stratified subset of the family D, determined by W. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for a weak extension to be an extension in terms of stratification. We investigate conditions for existence of extensions and introduce the notion of perfectly-stratified set of default rules and its variant of maximally perfectly-stratified set. Existence of such set of default rules turns out to be equivalent to the existence of extension. Finally, we investigate convergence of algorithm for computing extensions.

AB  - An integrated Operator Advisor System (OAS) has been built using generic task methodology. The operator's activities of plant monitoring, data interpretation, procedure execution, and diagnosis have been implemented as the four generic tasks in the system. The OAS is capable of identifying the abnormal functioning of the plant in terms of threats to safety, preenumerated abnormal events, and deviations from normality. After the identification of abnormal functioning, the system will identify the procedures to be executed to mitigate the consequences of abnormal functioning and will help the operator by displaying the procedure steps and monitoring the success of actions taken. The system also is capable of diagnosing the cause of abnormal functioning. The diagnosis is done in parallel to the task of procedure execution.

AB  - This paper describes an intelligent diagnostic system for an interconnected distribution network developed to assist the system operator with fault identification during restoration. The intelligent process utilizes only those data available in a standard SCADA system such as the post fault network status the list of the tripped breakers main protection alarm and the conventional event log. The fault diagnostic system is implemented by three independent mechanisms namely the generic core rule the generic relay setting inference and the specific postfault network matching and learning. The generic core rule generates various possible fault locations and the generic relay inference examines whether each possible fault location is logical and valid. The specific network matching compares whether the post fault network and the related tripped breakers are identical to a previous fault event. Test results obtained from two distribution networks confirm that the developed system is practical reliable and accurate. Â© 1997 IEEE.

AB  - Modeling of material behavior generally involves the development of mathematical models derived from observations and experimental data. An alternative way discussed in this paper, is neural network-based modeling that is a subfield of artificial intelligence. The main benefit in using a neural network approach is that the network is built directly from experimental or theoretical data using the self-organizing capabilities of the neural network. In this article, a back-propagation neural network package (NETICE) was presented which has been developed for use in general purpose work. NETICE (Neural nETworks In Civil Engineering) has been used in the design of edge-supported reinforced concrete slabs and the results are presented in this study. It has been observed that the results given by the network has a good approximation when compared with the conventional solution.

AB  - Prediction of preterm birth is a poorly understood domain. The existing manual methods of assessment of preterm birth are 17%-38% accurate. The machine learning system LERS was used for three different datasets about pregnant women. Rules induced by LERS were used in conjunction with a classification scheme of LERS, based on "bucket brigade algorithm" of genetic algorithms and enhanced by partial matching. The resulting prediction of preterm birth in new, unseen cases is much more accurate (68%-90%).

AB  - This paper describes DINT, a data interpretation expert system which can provide an explanation of the real-time operating state of a substation to its operators. DINT is based on a generalized version of the set covering model for diagnostic problem solving. This abductive reasoning model is an object-based, frame-like knowledge representation paradigm. Test cases illustrate the application of the model to the real-time operation of a substation. Â© 1992 IEEE

AB  - What can we look forward too? Lots of fun with new CAD/CAM systems that will enhance dentistry, providing quality restorations quickly. The evolution of an array of new versions of already available systems as well as altogether new systems will provide improved quality, expanded capabilities, and increasing user friendliness. And new materials will be more esthetic, wear more nearly like enamel, and strong enough for full crowns and bridges. We can also look forward to lots of change. Because of the cost of CAD/CAM systems, many clinicians are likely to collaborate by sharing a single system. Laboratories and clinicians may collaborate as well, with data being gathered in the operatory and sent to a laboratory via modem. The fabrication would then be done by the laboratory. Other changes that we cannot even predict are likely to occur in dentistry. Exciting times are here. Automation through dental CAD/CAM systems will, most certainly, change the profession. The impact of that change will only be known in the future. But as the future approaches, the systems and materials available to us will continue to evolve, improve, and enhance dentistry.

AB  - Symbol manipulation as used in traditional Artificial Intelligence has been criticized by neural net researchers for being excessively inflexible and sequential. On the other hand, the application of neural net techniques to the types of high-level cognitive processing studied in traditional artificial intelligence presents major problems as well. We claim that a promising way out of this impasse is to build neural net models that accomplish massively parallel case-based reasoning. Case-based reasoning, which has received much attention recently, is essentially the same as analogy-based reasoning, and avoids many of the problems leveled at traditional artificial intelligence. Further problems are avoided by doing many strands of case-based reasoning in parallel, and by implementing the whole system as a neural net. In addition, such a system provides an approach to some aspects of the problems of noise, uncertainty and novelty in reasoning systems. We are accordingly modifying our current neural net system (Conposit), which performs standard rule-based reasoning, into a massively parallel case-based reasoning version. Â© 1992.

AB  - For several years researchers at the JCEM have sought ways to apply various artificial intelligence methods to commercial building HVAC operations. This paper, based on two earlier articles, reports on some of the key results of work at Colorado. Expert system enhanced with neural networks trained by historical building data appear to be particularly promising for efficient and semi-automatic supervision of HVAC systems for commercial buildings. It appears that the over reliance on logic associated with expert systems alone can be reduced with a bettwe results neurl networks. Â© 1992.

AB  - An artificial-intelligence-based algorithm is developed for scheduling thermal generators in a 24-hour schedule horizon. The primary requirement of meeting the daily system load demand and spinning reserve, the ramp rate characteristics and minimum up and down times of units, and the operational constraints including the crew constraints, station synchronisation intervals, station shut-down intervals and the allowable operating limits of units, are incorporated in the algorithm. The scheduling algorithm consists of an algorithm for the run-up-to-peak period, an algorithm for the period between the midday and midafternoon peaks and an algorithm for the end-of-day decommitment period. The algorithms are based on the heuristic-guided depth-first search technique. A 'look-ahead' and 'constraint satisfaction' technique is also developed in the algorithm for the scheduling period between the midday and midafternoon peaks. The combinatorial explosion in the search space of the scheduling problem is greatly reduced by the use of the heuristics derived, some of which are based on economic considerations. A method for further reducing the search space to a manageable size is also developed. In addition, a new and recursive algorithm for solving the power dispatch problem is developed. This algorithm is employed in the 24-hour scheduling algorithm in the process of evaluating the costs of the generated schedules. The application of the developed scheduling algorithm to schedule ten thermal generators, implemented in Prolog, is presented.

AB  - The beacon logic-based configurator is designed to ensure the correct and complete configuration of large computer systems at the time of order entry. BEACON is based on a semantic network, KNET, implemented in PROLOG. Unlike other configuration expert systems, BEACON uses a declarative, logic-based approach, as opposed to a data-driven production system or hybrid design. Among other virtues, this allows for a completely interactive ordering session which is guaranteed correct with respect to the underlying model, rather than a batch-mode order-correcting system. KNET allows for configuration by individuation of an abstract, generic representation in a manner that is analogous to the instantiation of logical variables in a PROLOG-style proof. Â© 1990.

AB  - This paper presents the details of a prototype of an intelligent alarm processor called the Advanced Alarm Processor (AAP). The AAP uses model-based reasoning methods to synthesize and suppress power system alarms in the on-line environment. These model-based reasoning and processing methods are a new approach to intelligent alarm processing. The transformer model presented in this paper is a subset of the complete AAP which also processes power system, communications, protection, and substation alarms. The transformer module is used to demonstrate the reasoning and message-handling methods. Finally, the utility of the AAP is demonstrated through tests in which raw Energy Management System (EMS) input alarms are processed by the prototype to produce higher-level messages. Â© 1997 IEEE.

AB  - To verify and optimize melting and treatment processes, especially for gray and ductile iron, a system was developed based on thermal analysis combined with artificial intelligence methods. Known as ATAS (adaptive thermal analysis software), its purpose is to analyze samples solidifying according to the stable system and make predictions about the risk for various casting defects, as well as estimating physical properties. The hardware consists of an industrial computer, an A/D converter and a twin stand for test samples.

AB  - We propose a framework that supports the recognition of plans and intentions behind speech acts through abductive inferences over discourse sentences. These inferences allow each agent to have an active and intelligent participation in dialogues, namely, in cooperative information-seeking dialogues. In our framework, the possible actions, events, states, and world knowledge are represented by extended logic programs (LP with explicit negation), and the abductive inference porcess is modeled by the framework proposed by Pereira et al. [13], which is based on the Well Founded Semantics augmented with explicit negation (WFSX) and contradiction removal semantics (CRSX). It will be shown how this framework supports abductive planning with Event Calculus [5], and some examples will be shown [10, 14] in the domain of information-seeking dialogues. Finally, some open problems will be pointed out. Â© 1995.

AB  - CompuHx* is an Interactive Health Appraisal System (IHAPS) used in the examining room to record patient information, assist in diagnosis, and provide a legible summary of findings. This paper describes Phase I of a longitudinal study in which 22 examiners (five system users and 17 non-users) responded to detailed surveys and interviews about the system. Findings indicated that both users and non-users had mixed feelings about the system's ease of use and impact on their jobs, but agreed that it would have value for their practice. Underlying their acceptance of the system was a common concern for maintaining a caring relationship with patients and not allowing computer technology to depersonalize the examining room. Examiners also expressed concerns about the implementation process.

AB  - Although many Knowledge Representation (KR) formalisms have been used to encode care guidelines, there are few direct comparisons among different formalisms. In order to compare their suitability for encoding care guidelines, three different KR formalisms were used to encode the National Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP) guideline. PROLOG, a First Order Logic system, CLASSIC, a frame-based representation system, and CLIPS, a production rule system, were used in the comparison. All three representations allowed accurate encoding of the guideline. PROLOG produced the most compact representation, but proved the most difficult to debug. The lack of arbitrary disjunction in CLASSIC greatly increased the complexity of the encoding. Overall, the CLIPS representation was the most intuitive and easiest to use.

AB  - This chapter presents the diagnostic knowledge and skills of expert competitive swimming coaches. Sport studies on expert/novice differences in coaches have primarily focused on quantitative and descriptive characteristics of coaches and their skills. To clarify this, most studies have focused on the outcome of the results of coaching actions and have not investigated the knowledge base and structures which enabled the coach to obtain those results. An example is the study of the number, types, and intervals of feedback which a coach gives an athlete or team. The chapter discusses verbal reports obtained through interviews and clinical diagnosis of the competitive freestyle swimming stroke to elicit and identify the coach's diagnostic knowledge. Such a methodology has pioneered by scientists in cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence (Al), decision science, medicine, and sport. Research on the diagnostic knowledge base of expert coaches in the sport domain, however, is rather sparse and in the area of competitive swimming it is virtually nonexistent. The pragmatic need to understand competent coaching arises from two sources: first the efficiency for swimming is lower than any other sport and second, relatively few coaches attain expert diagnostic skills while the majority remain rather average, even after 10 or more years of coaching.

AB  - A graphics-oriented, primarily PC-based tool for education, research and training in power engineering is introduced. The tool called COPERITE has all user interfaces resident on an âIBM-386â microcomputer. Menus and windows are used generously for the interface and attractive graphical representations and displays are used. Application programs that are interfaced are power flow, contingency analysis, economic dispatch, security-constrained dispatch, system stability and fault analysis. These programs are executed on a VAX 8800 computer mainly for speed of execution. Information exchange between the PC and the VAX is made through an ethernet connection which is transparent to the user. Results of execution show up on the graphical front-end accessible to the user. COPERITE has a powerful network editor having the capabilities of adding, deleting, moving and finding symbols with a graphics cursor. Provisions are present for building and using artificial intelligence techniques for system operation enhancement. Â© 1992 IEEE

AB  - Neural network technology offers a number of opportunities for the control of power plants. Neural networks can learn the performance characteristics of existing plants from plant monitoring data and can be used to forecast demands, simulate plant operations, and control plant paremeters. Neural networks can substitute for the real system in predicting system responses for dynamic control purposes. Neural network learning can be continuous, so that the networks can automatically adapt to changing characteristics of the plant. The development of neural network simulators does not require advanced skills in computer simulation or in statistical methods. This paper demonstrates the possible uses and derivations of neural networks in plant control using actual boiler plant data. A linear programming model is presented which allows the values of the control variables to be optimally determined from the specificed limits on the controlled parameters.

AB  - Abstract. The current literature in the Artificial Intelligence and Law field reveals uncertainty concerning the potential role of deontic logic in legal knowledge representation. For instance, the Logic Programming Group at Imperial College has shown that a good deal can be achieved in this area in the absence of explicit representation of the deontic notions. This paper argues that some rather ordinary parts of the law contain structures which, if they are to be represented in logic, will call for use of a reasonably sophisticated deontic logic.

AB  - The reliability of multicomponent assemblages is of interest to engineers in many disciplines. It has been shown that the reliability of a multicomponent assembly-a simple frame-may be estimated through the use of a causal network. The causal network approach does not require the modelling of a structure as series or non-series; it only requires that the network of component reliabilities by acyclical. Assumptions about local member influence are implicitly included only through the use of conditional probability matrices throughout the network. These matrices may be generated through the use of a noisy OR gate and/or a rule-based system. It is postulated that the system reliability of any multicomponent assemblage can be estimated in this manner. Testing of the application of the concept to problems of realistic dimensions is currently under way. Â© 1990.

AB  - This paper introduces the concept of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI). It seeks to demonstrate the applicability of these techniques to the development of Intelligent Manufacturing Systems. The paper illustrates how a simple manufacturing process could be modelled via a confederation of intelligent agents, cooperating in an opportunistic manner in order to achieve the manufacture of a particular product in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner. In conclusion the paper suggests that DAI techniques must be harnessed if more effective construction of Intelligent Manufacturing Systems is ever to be achieved. Â© 1990 CIRP.

AB  - Major construction firms often face a difficult decision about the optimum combination of projects to select from a range of available projects. This decision usually requires the evaluation of all feasible combinations of projects and the choice of the combination that has the highest net present value associated with it. Defining all of the possible combinations of projects becomes increasingly cumbersome as the number of projects increases and as the number of years on the planning horizon increases. In this article, an artificial intelligence search strategy called the genetic algorithm, which is based on evolution theory, is proposed to determine the optimum set of projects, considering the interdependencies of projects, the limitations of resources, environmental constraints, and the managerial policies faced by a typical construction firm.

AB  - What few successes artificial intelligence (AI) has had point up the weakness of computerized reasoning as much as they do its narrow strengths. After initial gains led to high expectations during the late 1970s and early 1960s, there was a bitter backlash against AI in both industry and government. And now that the world has all but given up on the AI dream, I believe that artificial intelligence stands on the brink of success. People share knowledge so easily that we seldom even think about it. Unfortunately, that makes it all the more difficult to build programs that do the same. Many of the prerequisite skills and assumptions have become implicit through millennia of cultural and biological evolution and through universal early childhood experiences. Before machines can share knowledge as flexibly as people do, those prerequisites need to be recapitulated somehow in explicit, computable forms. This paper discusses the progress made in this direction by the CYC project and predicts what may be in store for the future.

AB  - Guiding the generation of abductive explanations is difficult. Applying case-based reasoning to abductive explanation generation offers the benefit of reusing successful explanatory reasoning, but raises new issues concerning how to perform similarity assessment to judge the relevance of prior explanations to new situations. Similarity assessment affects two points in the case-based explanation process. The problem of identifying similar explanations to retrieve is addressed by basing that similarity assessment on a categorization of anomaly types. It is shown that the problem of evaluating retrieved candidate explanations is often impeded by incomplete information about the situation to be explained. Hence, the problem is addressed with constructive similarity assessment, which addresses the problem of incomplete input cases by building up and reasoning about augmented descriptions of those cases, based on adaptation of prior cases.

AB  - Hierarchical systems incorporating intelligent controllers have been proposed for use in process control of complex systems, including nuclear power plants. In contrast to these proposals, the controllers that are used in today's operational plants are very simple, and are likely to remain so unless the industry can be convinced that more sophisticated control concepts are compatible with its demanding requirements for reliability, validation and verification. The paper analyzes these requirements and proposes a concept of system architecture that has the capacity to meet them. Essential properties of the proposed methodology are modularity of the design and distributed autonomy within each module. These features are needed to ensure a system that can be implemented and tested incrementally and which will exhibit robustness in the event of plant or control system failures that render individual controller subsystems ineffective. The design of an intelligent controller for a feedwater heater is described and provides an illustrative example of the proposed concept. Â© 1993 IEEE

AB  - This paper examines the processes involved in building instructional applications that are based in artificial intelligence (AI) and hypermedia (HM) technologies. It seeks to define an initial methodology to capture these processes in a systematic manner, thus laying the foundations for the emergence of an ISD-like technology of design in the field of intelligent tutoring and advanced technologies. The joint consideration of AI and HM technologies in this respect is deliberate, for even if each appears to favour somewhat different instructional strategies from the other (Duchastel, 1990; 1991), the two technologies are nevertheless merging into integrated knowledge-based systems within the scope of computer-hosted training (McAleese, 1991).

AB  - We describe a multimedia program for teaching anatomy. The program, called the Anatomy Browser, displays cross-sectional and topographical images, with outlines around structures and regions of interest. The user may point to these structures and retrieve text descriptions, view symbolic relationships between structures, or view spatial relationships by accessing 3-D graphics animations from videodiscs produced specifically for this program. The software also helps students exercise what they have learned by asking them to identify structures by name and location. The program is implemented in a client-server architecture, with the user interface residing on a Macintosh, while images, data, and a growing symbolic knowledge base of anatomy are stored on a fileserver. This architecture allows us to develop practical tutorial modules that are in current use, while at the same time developing the knowledge base that will lead to more intelligent tutorial systems.

AB  - In Knowledge Based TITV, the transmission bandwidth is not dependent on screen size, resolution or scanning rate but rather only on novelty and movement. The moving portion of the input image is compared with previously learned image sections to generate Superpixel codes for transmission. A Superpixel may contain any size image section, from single pixel to entire images. Digital Superpixel transmission promises near perfect images for HDTV at orders of magnitude lower bandwidth and, if desired, in a virtually unbreakable encryption code. Â© 1990 IEEE

AB  - This paper proposes the use of fuzzy neural networks (FNN) to solve the fault location problem for Series-Compensated Lines. The technique is based on a hybrid intelligent model that integrates artificial neural networks (ANN) and fuzzy logic system (FLS). The frequency components of the instantaneous three phase voltages and currents derived at the fault locator-end of the line are used to train an ANN to classify the fault type, and a separate FNN is used to accurately locate a fault on EHV Series-Compensated Lines.

AB  - Real-time traffic flow management has recently emerged as one of the promising approaches to alleviating congestion. This approach uses real-time and predicted traffic information to develop routing strategies that attempt to optimize the performance of the highway network. A survey of existing approaches to real-time traffic management indicated that they suffer from several limitations. In an attempt to overcome these, the authors developed an architecture for a routing decision support system (DSS) based on two emerging artificial intelligence paradigms: case-based reasoning and stochastic search algorithms. This architecture promises to allow the routing DSS to (a) process information in real time, (b) learn from experience, (c) handle the uncertainty associated with predicting traffic conditions and driver behavior, (d) balance the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and (e) deal with missing and incomplete data problems.

AB  - In recent years, neural networks have been proposed that portray many of the complexities of adaptive behavior. The networks describe how agents learn to predict future events by 1) building models of the world, 2) inferring new predictions from past experiences, 3) combining elementary environmental stimuli into complex internal representations, 4) attending to stimuli associated with environmental novelty, and 5) attending to stimuli that are good predictors of other environmental events. When a predictive network is attached to a goal-seeking system, the resulting architecture is able to describe spatial and maze navigation, as well as problem solving and planning. When the predictions of future events are based on the combination of environmental stimuli and the animal's own responses, the networks provide the information necessary to choose between alternative behaviors. When the agent's own responses can be identified with the responses of other agents, the networks can describe learning by imitation. Whereas some of the agent's responses produce substantial modifications of the environment, others simply constitute signals used to communicate with other agents. In addition to affecting the behavior of other agents, these signals have an effect in the emitting animal itself. It is suggested that these principles might be applied to the design of adaptive, communicating autonomous robots. Â© 1996 IEEE.

AB  - Cost-effective health care is at the forefront of today's important health-related issues. A research team at the University of Pittsburgh has been interested in lowering the cost of medical care by attempting to define a subset of patients with community-acquire pneumonia for whom outpatient therapy is appropriate and safe. Sensitivity and specificity requirements for this domain make it difficult to use rule-based learning algorithms with standard measures of performance based on accuracy. This paper describes the use of misclassification costs to assist a rule-based machine-learning program in deriving a decision-support aid for choosing outpatient therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

AB  - The potential of praziquantel (PZ) to induce cancers in rodents was evaluated using a structure-activity relational expert system (CASE/MULTICASE). The analyses indicated that based upon structural features PZ had the potential for being a ânongenotoxicâ carcinogen. The potential risk to humans of nongenotoxic carcinogens is considered to be much less than that posed by âgenotoxicâ ones. Moreover, PZ has demonstrated therapeutic effectiveness against parasitic diseases that affect millions of individuals. Additionally, PZ was developed to replace antiparasitic agents which mere genotoxic rodent carcinogens. Thus, on balance, the beneficial effects of PZ appear to outweigh its potential for causing harm to humans. Â© 1995 Academic Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper is devoted to a description of one knowledge representation method for intelligent systems: heterogeneous semantic nets (HN). HNs can be treated as oriented graphs with labelled nodes and branches, since each node is a set of ordered pairs, while branches having different labels have different algebraic properties, different semantics and, consequently, different interpretation procedures. This paper examines certain problems that occur in developed applied intelligent systems that have been recognized in recent years; knowledge models based on heterogeneous semantic nets are described and analyzed.

AB  - Human wayfinding is a goal-directed process of determining routes through an unfamiliar environment. Understanding wayfinding behavior has important implications for our ability to explain and predict spatial behavior and for our attempts to plan and design the built environment for human use. This article reviews research on wayfinding in built environments. Two distinct yet complementary research perspectives are discussed: the environment-behavior and the artificial intelligence approaches to understanding wayfinding. Closer linkages between these perspectives have implications at both the theoretical and applied levels. Â© 1992, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of qualitative modelling of discrete-time continuous-variable dynamical systems, for which only a quantized measurement [x(k)] of the state x(k) is available. The qualitative model has to describe the qualitative trajectory x(1), x(2), . . . for given qualitative initial state x(0) and qualitative input sequence. First, it is shown that the qualitative trajectory of the system is ambiguous. Hence, the qualitative model has to be non-deterministic. Secondly, it is shown that non-deterministic automata provide reasonable qualitative models of the continuous-variable system. The relation between the automaton and the given system shows what knowledge about the system has to be available if the qualitative model is to be set up. Thirdly, we propose to use stochastic automata, which provide a means for weighting each state concerning its appearance on the qualitative trajectory of the continuous-variable system. On this basis, the set of spurious solutions, which exist for any qualitative model, can be reduced. The suitability of the model becomes obvious by designing a qualitative controller. The results are illustrated by the problem of stabilizing an `inverted pendulum'.

AB  - This paper describes an expert system interface, named (ihs), for the interactive data analysis and system identification program Idpac. The interface works as an intelligent help system. The system is completely noninvasive and uses the previous command history to understand what the user is doing and gives help according to this. This way of monitoring the user's activities is called the command spy strategy. Scripts are used for representing procedural knowledge, and production rules for diagnostic knowledge. The system has been implemented and a knowledge database handling system identification with the maximum-likelihood method has been developed. An example run with the system is included. Â© 1991.

AB  - The most difficult problem facing the success of future consumer home automation products is not a purely technical one: how to make the products or systems intuitive to use, work together, yet powerful enough to have real perceived value to the consumer. The paper describes how existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are directly applicable to solving the human interface problem of home automation products even when the âsystem intelligenceâ is widely distributed among different products sharing a common home network.

AB  - A prototype, on-line, expert system has been developed at Chevron Corp.'s Richmond, Calif., refinery to advise and train process operators. The system models the experience and decision making capability of the operator, rather than automating the decision process by modeling process equipment and operations. The system, called OpAS for Operator Advisor System, coaches operators to make correct decisions so that consistent shift-to-shift control strategy can be maintained, thus minimizing variability in production, product qualities, and operating costs. It can also be used to train inexperienced operators. The system can operate on-line, meaning it has access to live plant data through a serial link to the plant's monitoring computer.

AB  - A methodology has been developed, and a prototype tool, the Maintenance Advisor, has been designed and implemented based on this methodology which would assist the scheduling and decision-making for performance of preventive maintenance activities in a plant, based on probabilistic judgedment and probabilistic inference rules. Using data on failure rates, repair times, repair costs and indirect economic costs (e.g. power replacement and accident risk), and within the imposed deterministic constrainst, the program develops an optimum (minimum expected cost) maintenance schedule for the various pieces of equipment described by the model. The Maintenance Advisor is a frame-based object-oriented tool, programed in KEE and Lisp. Equipment and other objects are represented as complex units, containing a complete set of characteristics, data and functional capabilities. Functional relations between the units are described in terms of two relations: TYPE-OF and PART-OF. The hierarchies formed by these relations serve as the basis for probabilistic and other inferences. Â© 1990.

AB  - Formalists and antiformalists continue to debate the utility of using legislative history and current social values to interpret statutes. Lost in the debate, however, is a clear model of how judges actually make decisions. Rather than focusing on complex problems presented by actual judicial decisions, formalists and antiformalists concentrate on stylized examples of simple statutes. In this Article, Professors Adams and Farber construct a more functional model of judicial decisionmaking by focusing on complex problems. They use cognitive psychological research on expert reasoning and techniques from an emerging area in the field of artificial intelligence, fuzzy logic, to construct their model. To probe the complex interactions between judicial interpretation, the business and legal communities, and the legislature, the authors apply their model to two important bankruptcy cases written by prominent formalist judges. Professors Adams and Farber demonstrate how cognitive psychology and fuzzy logic can reveal the reasoning processes that both formalist and antiformalist judges use to interpret complex statutes. To apply formalist rules, judges need to recognize the aspects of a case that trigger relevant rules. Cognitive psychologists have researched expert reasoning using this type of diagnostic process. Once the judge identifies the appropriate rules, she will often find they point in conflicting directions. Fuzzy logic provides a model of how to analyze such conflicts. Next, Professors Adams and Farber consider how these models of judicial decisionmaking inform efforts to improve statutory interpretation of complex statutes. They reason that expert decisionmaking builds on pattern recognition skills and fuzzy maps, both the result of intensive repeated experience. The authors explain that cases involving complex statutory interpretation frequently involve competing considerations, and that the implicit understandings of field "insiders" tend to be entrenched and difficult to displace. Consequently, Professors Adams and Farber argue that judges in specialty courts, such as the Bankruptcy Courts, are probably in a better position than generalist appellate judges to interpret complex statutes. Generalist judges should approach complex statutory issues with a strong degree of deference to the "local culture" of the field. Professors Adams and Farber conclude the Article with speculation on how fuzzy logic could be used in a more quantitative way to model legal problems. They note that computer modeling may ultimately provide insight into the subtle process of judicial practical reasoning, moving away from the false dichotomy often drawn between formalist and antiformalist approaches to practical judicial decision-making.

AB  - Most transportation infrastructure planning studies are conducted with only a few alternative networks and land use scenarios. Generally, these studies analyze only a few transportation-related measures of effectiveness, such as vehicle-miles traveled, congestion, and air-quality emissions. When such a small subset of possible alternatives and variables is analyzed, it is probable that optimal alternative designs are not included. Ideally, all combinations of land use, infrastructure, and social variables would be examined; however, even a small city of 200 traffic zones with an average of 10 land uses will have more than 10200 possible zoning alternatives. A more efficient way to examine an extremely large search set of feasible designs is to employ artificial intelligence techniques to quickly narrow the number of alternatives to be considered. The use of a multiobjective genetic algorithm model to optimize land use, infrastructure, social, and fiscal variables is demonstrated. The model considers three primary objective functions: minimizing travel time, minimizing per capita cost (as related to property taxes), and minimizing land use change. A large number of constraints are used. A Pareto fitness function is used to develop a small set of optimal solutions. The model was applied to Provo, Utah, which is a fast-growing community. More than 1.9 million alternative designs were evaluated, and 195 optimal Pareto plans were found. The Pareto set of optimal solutions indicated that solutions clustering higher-density development along existing arterials were most likely to meet the objectives.

AB  - Electroplating is a major process in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards. Scheduling the movement of material handling hoists for electroplating processes is generally known as the Hoist Scheduling Problem (HSP) and has been proven to be NP-complete. The objective of HSP is to find a cyclic sequence of hoist moves that maximizes the production throughput. For the past two decades, various optimization and heuristic techniques have been proposed to solve the problem. However, these methods are often limited to the elementary problems. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) approach using constraint logic programming has been applied to solve the cyclic HSP, but did not consider problems with duplicated process tanks. In this paper, we apply constraint satisfaction to solve HSP with duplicate process tanks. A binary search procedure is proposed and a tighter bound to the cycle length is introduced to reduce the computation effort. The proposed algorithm can be easily implemented on any personal computer with reasonable performance so as to be useful on the shop floor. Finally, we present results for several benchmark examples.

AB  - Multilevel representations have been studied extensively by artificial intelligence researchers. We present a general method that utilizes the multilevel paradigm to attack the problem of performing multidiscipline engineering design optimization in the presence of many local optima. The method uses a multidisciplinary simulator at multiple levels of abstraction, paired with a multilevel search space. We tested the method in the domain of conceptual design of supersonic transport aircraft, focusing on the airframe and the exhaust nozzle, and using sequential quadratic programming as the optimizer at each level. We found that using multilevel simulation and optimization can decrease the cost of design space search by an order of magnitude.

AB  - Electronic Warfare (EW) Support Measures (ESM) systems are evolving rapidly toward unmanned status by using a constellation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Among these are artificial neural networks (ANN), genetic algorithms, intelligent databases, fuzzy logic and data fusion techniques, as well as expert systems. The applications and implementation techniques, for which adaptive autonomous non cooperative target recognition is useful or necessary, form the focus of this discussion. Military and civilian applications abound for fixed site, shipborne, and airborne systems. These systems could control and manage other interactive systems normally requiring manual inputs. Applications such as air and marine traffic control and management regimes, collection of transport traffic statistics for economic analysis and intelligence, passive targeting, platform inventory (order of battle), and anti-fratricide control are examples meeting this requirement. ESM systems use these Al technologies throughout the signal processing chain and beyond: from acquisition through automatic RF band scheduling and antenna pointing, as well as deinterleaving of dense signal environments and characterization of individual emitters, to rapid, hjgh-cunfidence emitter-platform correlation with automatic optical/IR imaging, and cross-indexing of multiple worldwide information databases to prevent platform aliasing. These systems are now- feasible because the required components are now available. Low-cost miniaturized RF system and subsystem components, massively parallel computing resources, and ANN integrated circuits permit the achievement of low-cost, low-power, small, modular systems that stand and act alone.

AB  - PROTEGE-II is a methodology and a suite of tools that allow developers to build and maintain knowledge-based systems in a principled manner. We used PROTEGE-II to reconstruct the well-known INTERNIST-I system, demonstrating the role of a domain ontology (a framework for specification of a model of an application area), a reusable problem-solving method, and declarative mapping relations in creating a new, working program. PROTEGE-II generates automatically a domain-specific knowledge-acquisition tool, which, in the case of the INTERNIST-I reconstruction, has much of the functionality of the QMR-KAT knowledge-acquisition tool. This study provides a means to understand better both the PROTEGE-II methodology and the models that underlie INTERNIST-I.

AB  - We present a language for representing context-sensitive temporal probabilistic knowledge. Context constraints allow inference to be focused on only the relevant portions of the probabilistic knowledge. We provide a declarative semantics for our language and an implemented algorithm (BNG) that generates Bayesian networks to compute the posterior probabilities of queries. We illustrate the use of the BNG system by applying it to the problem of modeling the effects of medications and other interventions on the condition of a patient in cardiac arrest.

AB  - This paper presents the CLAIRE concepts for an independent AI-based supervisor for traffic control. This system is issued from considerations on adaptive systems, congestion management, role of operators and the contribution of systems for information with drivers. CLAIRE implements a universal layer which can be interfaced with the specific layer of the control system. It ensures an on-line congestion monitoring and control. It gives off-line aids to the analysis of congestion patterns and a learning capability for the development of congestion control actions. It contributes to the elaboration of a long-term memory of congestion patterns. The conceptual level and architecture of the CLAIRE system allow one to address the problem of integration with other advanced transport telematics systems such as route guidance, traffic information, parking management and public transport. -Author

AB  - A method of selecting tools for the manufacture of turned components is described. The system, which is user-friendly, is capable of dealing with all the operations normally associated with the manufacture of turned components. The tools, particularly those for external turning operations, an chosen so that optimum economic performance eg minimum cost is achieved. While the system does include a number of automatic routines and is, in fact, capable of automatically selecting the tools, the user can interact with it and override the system choice. However, if the system is overridden the user is informed of any increase in cost caused by the choice of an alternative tool or tools. Â© 1993 CIRP.

AB  - Identification of 3-D cutting dynamics requires an expensive experimental set-up and complicated analysis. Recently, time series methods were used to model cutting dynamics. This approach allows a simpler experimental set-uup and estimates the discrete transfer functions used for simulation and/or calculation of frequency domain characteristics of the system. In this paper, the use of neural networks is proposed to model the 3-D cutting dynamics. Neural networks can be trained using the same experimental set-up used for the time series methods. However, several time series models (for different cutting speeds) can be represented with a single neural network, and cutting forces can be studied for varying cutting speed conditions. Also, four neural networks were used to store the frequency domain characteristics of the thrust direction cutting force. In this study, the estimation errors for the neural networks were less than 7% of the defined range (the difference between the maximum and minimum of the data). Â© 1992.

AB  - ROENTGEN is a design assistant for radiation therapy planning which uses case-based reasoning, an artificial intelligence technique. It learns both from specific problem-solving experiences and from direct instruction from the user. The first sort of learning is the normal case-based method of storing problem solutions so that they can be reused. The second sort is necessary because ROENTGEN does not, initially, have an internal model of the physics of its problem domain. This dependence on explicit user instruction brings to the forefront representational questions regarding indexing, failure definition, failure explanation and repair. This paper presents the techniques used by ROENTGEN in its knowledge acquisition and design activities.

AB  - The largest threat to the efficient and safe operation of complex processes comes from erroneous actions by the humans in the system. The number of erroneous actions can be reduced and the consequences be mitigated in two principally different ways. The passive approach concentrates on how the system is designed, implemented and applied. The active approach concentrates on the system in use, as exemplified by automation in various forms, protection systems, computerised operator support, and various types of expert systems. A specific solution is to make the systems fault tolerant, i.e. forgiving of erroneous actions and able to limit the consequences through interlocks and automatic shut-down mechanisms. Yet practically all fault tolerant systems come into action after the erroneous action has occurred and has had a detectable effect. It would clearly be attractive to detect erroneous actions when they occur, possibly before they have had any effect, i.e. effectively to prevent them from happening. The paper describes the development and functioning of a system which provides an on-line detection of erroneous actions in a process domain. The system, which is called RESQ, is based on a combination of plan recognition, plan evaluation and error handling. It has been developed within the ESPRIT Project P857 'Graphical Dialogue Environment', and is presently implemented for a data network. RESQ is written in Common LISP and is, with the necessary exception of a plan library, completely domain independent. Â© 1992.

AB  - This paper outlines why artificial intelligence (ai) topics should assume a more prominent rÃ´le in the discipline of computing science. Moreover, an argument is presented for considering ai as the cultural foundation for computing science. Key ai topics are discussed, as well as the importance of the laboratory component. Emphasis is placed on what could be done in the laboratory and in courses "outside" the ai course to reinforce the central concepts. A proposal is made that, given the importance of this material, the core topics should be required for students in mathematics, science and engineering, in addition to those in computing science.

AB  - The idea of distributed planning and problem solving as a reliable and effective methodology for air traffic control is introduced. Some basic concepts and terminology of distributed planning are first discussed, then a novel coordinator-coworker structure is described: this is a control mechanism that can dynamically reorganise the planning system in response to the task at hand. The information structure supporting such a control mechanism is made up of hierarchically organised distributed scratch pads. It also provides the basis for 'self-repairing' when individual nodes fail to operate, and allows for a graceful degradation of the whole system. The problems of air traffic control are analysed and the kernel design of the airborne processors in a location-centred co-operative planning system is described. The simulation-based planning process and its timing and selection considerations are explained. Three different organisational structures are implemented: the local centralised architecture, and the location-centred co-operative planning system with one- and two-level coordinator-coworker hierarchies. The vehicle of the empirical studies, the distributed air traffic control testbed, is then introduced, and performance measures of the three organisational structures are compared in it. Finally, the design and the results of a series of experiments performed are discussed.

AB  - Fuzzy control theory has progressed from the founding concept by Zadeh in 1965, to application to industrial control by Mamdani in 1977, and is now being combined with artificial intelligence techniques. General purpose fuzzy controllers and fuzzy logic LSI chips are available. This paper introduces the subject of fuzzy logic control (FLC) and provides a comprehensive literature survey of applications. The design and implementation of a FLC controller is described followed by a critical review of the FLC of machining.

AB  - Functionalism is at present widely accepted as a working basis for cognitive science and artificial intelligence. This view holds that psychological phenomena can be adequately described in terms of functional processes carried out in the brain, and that these processes can be understood independently of the detailed structure and mode of development of the brain. In the functionalist view, the brain is analogous to a computer; both can properly be described at the level of symbolic representations and algorithms. However, an analysis of the structure, development, and evolution of the brain makes it highly unlikely that it could be a Turing machine or that brain algorithms could be either acquired by experience in the world or transmitted between generations. An alternative view is that the brain is a selective system in which two different domains of stochastic variation, the world and neural repertoires, become mapped onto each other in an individual, historical manner. Neural systems capable of such mapping can generalize and can deal with novelty in an open-ended environment. Several models have been constructed to test these ideas, including automata of a new kind that can recognize and associate patterns of sensory input by selective mechanisms. In an approach called synthetic neural modelling, the environment, the phenotype, and the nervous system of such an automaton are integrated into a single computer model. One example is Darwin III, a sessile "creature" with an eye and a multi-jointed arm having a sense of touch; its environment consists of simple shapes moving on a featureless background; its nervous system consists of some 50 000 cells of 50 different kinds connected by about 620 000 synaptic junctions. Darwin III can be trained to track moving objects with its eye, to reach out and touch objects with its arm, to categorize objects according to combinations of visual and tactile cues, and to respond in a positive or negative way to such objects depending on previous experience with similar objects. Synthetic neural models give insight into how biological pattern recognizing systems might operate and may provide paradigms for the construction of improved pattern recognizing and classifying automata.

AB  - Knowledge base building environments must progress in two important directions: (i) increased participation of domain experts in the knowledge design process through new computational models and effective man-machine interfaces; and (ii) automated knowledge acquisition tools to facilitate the overt expression of knowledge. This paper presents the integration of a knowledge acquisition methodology with a performance system. The resulting architecture represents a combination of techniques from psychology, cognitive sciences and artificial intelligence. New dimensions emerge from this implementation and integration both at the theoretical and practical levels. The overall system is not linked to a particular control structure and is not task dependent. We discuss the value of intermediate representations in this context and the role of different approaches to the induction process. Topological induction is particularly efficient in the elicitation process and stresses the importance of interactive inductive techniques with participation from the experts. While the knowledge acquisition tool provides an analysis and structuring of the domain knowledge, the control is implemented using the performance system's interface. Therefore, both modules participate in the overall knowledge acquisition process. Beyond the integration of these knowledge acquisition and performance systems, the architecture can also be integrated with databases, text analysis techniques, and hypermedia systems.

AB  - This paper develops an algorithm which is suitable for implementation on computers by a logic programming language, Prolog, for scheduling thermal generators to meet the daily rising system demand and spinning reserve requirement in the operation of power systems. The algorithm is based on the depth-first and heuristic search techniques in artificial intelligence, and an interpretation of the scheduling process as a tree searching problem. Heuristic rules are derived for overcoming the problem of combinatorial explosion in the search space of the scheduling process and for quickly determining the solution schedule having the lowest total excessive generation capacity between the total generation capacity and the combined system demand and spinning reserve.

AB  - We describe in this paper a computer program for Automated Mathematical Modelling and Simulation (AMMS) for Bacteria growth control in the food industry using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. This computer program is an implementation of a new method for AMMS using Expert Systems Technology and Fractal Theory developed by the authors. We show in this paper mathematical models expressed as differential equations, for the simulation of bacteria growth for several types of food. The goal of constructing this models is to capture the dynamics of bacteria population in food, so as to have a way of controlling this dynamics for Industrial purposes. Controlling the growth of bacteria is very important in industrial microbiology in obtaining the food products with the desired chemical and microbiological properties. The goal of controlling the growth of bacteria population can be achieved, by computer simulations and application of the theory of dynamical systems. We also use the fractal dimension as a tool for the identification of bacteria by measuring the geometrical complexity of the colonies. This method of identification is based on the experimental fact that different types of bacteria have colonies of different geometrical form and complexity.

AB  - This paper outlines some of the research and development that Lloyd's Register has undertaken into the field of machinery condition monitoring in recent years. This work commenced in the early 1980s with the investigation of the influence of fuel quality on diesel engine wear and corrosion, and then progressed through the use of embedded intelligence, and the necessary algorithms required in condition monitoring methodologies, to the question of fault visibility, sensor reliability and the relative advantages of steady and transient condition monitoring. Based on this programme of research, a summary of the major conclusions is presented, together with experience gained from the practical application of vibration and integrated machinery condition monitoring systems to ships.

AB  - T396, Artificial Intelligence for Technology; is a distance learning course provided by the Open University of the UK. It is based around a learning model which combines conceptualization, construction and dialogue. This allows a practical emphasis which has previously been difficult to implement within the constraints of distance education. The course uses commercial software, real-world based assignments and a project to replace the conventional exam. The course components facilitate the successful combination of the practical emphasis and the academic theory. A computer conference allows dialogue between students. The course has been evaluated by student questionnaire and for the key criteria received responses in the top quarter of the ratings band. Â© 1997 European Society for Engineering Education.

AB  - Condition-based maintenance (CBM) is an emerging technology, which seeks to develop sensors and processing systems aimed at monitoring the operation of complex machinery such as turbine engines, rotor craft drivetrains, and industrial equipment. The goal of CBM systems is to determine the state of the equipment (i.e., the mechanical health and status), and to predict the remaining useful life for the system being monitored. The success of such systems depends upon a number of factors, including: (1) the ability to design or use robust sensors for measuring relevant phenomena such as vibration, acoustic spectra, infrared emissions, oil debris, etc.; (2) real-time processing of the sensor data to extract useful information (such as features or data characteristics) in a noisy environment and to detect parametric changes that might be indicative of impending failure conditions; (3) fusion of multi-sensor data to obtain improved information beyond that available to a single sensor; (4) micro and macro level models, which predict the temporal evolution of failure phenomena; and finally, (5) the capability to perform automated approximate reasoning to interpret the results of the sensor measurements, processed data, and model predictions in the context of an operational environment. The latter capability is the focus of this paper. Although numerous techniques have emerged from the discipline of artificial intelligence for automated reasoning (e.g., rule-based expert systems, blackboard systems, case-based reasoning, neural networks, etc.), none of these techniques are able to satisfy all of the requirements for reasoning about condition-based maintenance. This paper provides an assessment of automated reasoning techniques for CBM and identifies a particular problem for CBM, namely, the ability to reason with negative information (viz., data which by their absence are indicative of mechanical status and health). A general architecture is introduced for CBM automated reasoning, which hierarchically combines implicit and explicit reasoning techniques. Initial experiments with fuzzy logic are also described.

AB  - The Paper considers the formalized Informational Macrosystemic Approach based on bi-level (micro- and macro-descriptions) of a complex object. Informational Macro Dynamics (IMD) contains formal mathematical and computer methodology to describe the transformation of random information processes into system dynamics to model the observed processes on the basis of both the discovery of their information dynamic regularities and the identification of macrodynamic equations. Random processes at microlevel are modelled by solutions of the controlled stochastic differential equations. The functional of 'action' as a Path integral on the microlevel stochastics evaluates a probability of approximating the microlevel processes by macrodynamics. The uncertainty of the microlevel processes is a source of the macrodynamics. Model of the macrolevel is based on variational principle for the functional 'action'. Dynamic model obtained from solution of the variation problem reflects the microlevel regularities, and is characterized by a discrete renovation of a dynamic operator as well as ability of its identification during process of optimal motion. The synthesized optimal macrodynamics give rise to the hierarchical self-organized structures, which are becoming ordered in the process of optimal motion. Computer methodology of system modelling, simulation and control with an IMD software package were applied to the series of processes in such areas as Technology, Engineering, Biology, Macroeconomics, Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - The future of telecommunications is widely accepted as being convergent with that of computing. This future will include a large number of third party service providers offering interactive multimedia services to diverse terminals over a broadband network. A prototype of the service control and management system needed to realise this capability is being built. The experiment has shown that state-of-the-art software techniques such as open distributed processing, artificial intelligence and object orientation must be used and interface standards between networks, terminals, servers and managers are also needed. This is beyond the scope of existing standards, but the designs are based on the deliverables of the TINA consortium, a global telecommunications industry forum which was started in 1993, and which will be influential, it is believed, in future standards.

AB  - Although anatomical terminology forms a part of biomedical structured vocabularies, available sources lack the requisite granularity, semantic types and relationships for comprehensively and consistently representing anatomical concepts in machine readable form. Thoracic angiology was selected as a proof of concept experiment for in depth representation of symbolic information in gross anatomy through the enhancement of semantic types, concepts and relationships in UMLS. Provided the representation of concepts is comprehensive, hierarchies generated with four types of simple relationships are capable of displaying anatomical information from the systemic view point with sufficient detail to meet the needs of applications in basic science education and in the practice of surgical subspecialties.

AB  - We have developed a computerized prompting system for test ordering which we feel will decrease the cost of investigations and at the same time promote an evidence based learning approach to test ordering. Prompting systems have been shown to be cost-effective but suffer from many disadvantages in the family practice setting. They tend to be difficult to modify by the user and contingent on an inflexible rule based structure. Many suggestions are ignored implying that they are not relevant. In family practice most conditions are of low prevalence. Prompting for test ordering where the pre-test likelihood of disease is small will result in a large number of false positives and many unnecessary repeat or confirmatory investigations and attendant anxiety unless the prompting system is specifically designed to be used in a low prevalence environment. PROMPTOR-FM (PRObabilistic Method of Prompting for Test ORdering in Family Medicine) was developed to overcome these perceived difficulties. It allows the physician to rapidly calculate the positive and negative predictive values of a test being considered based on the clinical index of suspicion. The physician is able to repeat the calculations and compare the results with previous calculations. By using PROMPTOR-FM repetitively, the clinician can learn to balance the risk of "missing" a rare but serious condition against the risk of falsely identifying disease with its downstream hazards and costs of further investigation. Prompting for test ordering is therefore uniquely tailored to each patient's situation.

AB  - In this work, we are presenting an object-oriented language to define distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) systems. This language allows for the description of control and communication management, a hierarchical representation of a DAI system at different levels of detail, and the simulation of its performance. The language is based on three different entities-sequential actors, distributed actors and channel managers. A sequential actor describes a single DAI module (agent). A distributed actor represents a net of agents characterizing both a whole DAI system and its sub-parts. A channel manager administers channel communications among agents. This paper specifically illustrates (i) how data and procedural abstraction properties of such a language satisfy all the representation requirements for modelling DAI systems, and (ii) how message passing in an access-oriented paradigm can be an excellent basis for the representation of the mechanisms which drive the performance of a DAI system. We conclude with an example of the language application. Â© 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the evaluation of liver abnormalities. The interpretation of MR images requires expert training in a rapidly changing field. DAFODILL (Decision Aid for Diagnosing Liver Lesions) is a decision-support tool designed to aid radiologists in the diagnosis of hepatic lesions seen on MRI. DAFODILL uses a knowledge base of MRI findings and a belief-network inference engine to generate probabilistic differential diagnoses of the most commonly encountered hepatic lesions. DAFODILL performs limited image processing to identify clinically relevant features, which are presented to the user for confirmation before they are used by the network. Preliminary evaluation of an initial version of the system suggests that DAFODILL may be a useful tool for radiology residents and nonexpert radiologists in interpreting MR images of the liver.

AB  - The past few years have witnessed a rapid growth of interest in a cluster of modes of modeling and computation which may be described collectively as softcomputing. The distinguishing characteristic of a soft computing is that its primary aim is to achieve tractability, robustness, low cost and high MIQ (machine intelligence quodent) through an exploitation of the tolerance for imprecision and uncertainty. Thus, in soft computing what is usually sought in an approximate solution to a precisely formulated problem or more typically, an approximate solution to an imprecisely formulated problem. A simple case in point is the problem of parking a car. Generally, humans can park a car rather easily because the final position of the car is not specified exactly. If it were specified to within, say, a few millimeters and a fraction of a degree, it would take hours or days of maneuvering and precise measurements of distance and angular position to solve the problem. What this simple example points to is the fact that, in general, high precision carries a high cost. The challenge, then, is to exploit the tolerance for imprecision by devising methods of computation which lead to an acceptable solution at low cost. By its nature, soft computing is much closer to human reasoning than the traditional modes of computation. At this juncture, the major components of soft computing are fuzzy logic (FL), neural network theory (NN) and probabilistic reasoning techniques (PR), including genetic algorithms, chaos theory and parts of learning theory. Increasingly, these techniques are used in combination to achieve significant improvement in performance and adaptability. Among the important application, areas for soft computing are control systems, expert systems, data compression techniques, image processing and decision support systems. It may be argued that it is soft computing -rather than the traditional hard computing- that should be viewed as the foundation for artificial intelligence. In the years ahead, this may well become a widely held position.

AB  - This paper presents a definition of engineering design that stresses the importance of representation as the key element in design. Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) provide new ways to represent design knowledge about designed artifacts and the design process. We provide illustrations from the fields of mechanical and architectural design of how the power and flexibility of AI-based, computer-aided design tools offer opportunities to better understand what designers do and for conveying this increased awareness in engineering education. We conclude that symbolic representation offers another language for engineering design that strengthens our engineering modeling capabilities. Â© 1993 IEEE

AB  - Summary: The integration of systems in the field of engineering activities on the basis of CA technology begins with the establishing of internal model ot a workpiece in, CAD system. Feature-based modelling offers a number of advantages over the classical geometrical modelling in the building ot integrated systems. This paper describes the architecture of CAD/CAI (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided inspection; integrated system based on the recognition of forms and artificial intelligence. As specific forms in the model may also appear the forms with complex surfaces. Initial result of the investigation justifies such an approach in the integration ot systems in the field of LA technologies. Â© 1992 CIRP.

AB  - Naval ship design is a complex, iterative decisionâmaking process that requires not only qualitative reasoning and quantitative computations, but also effective handling of massive amounts of information. The development of a systematic procedure in the form of an interactive Decision Support System (DSS) incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can assist in improving the design process. The DSS reported in this paper integrates conventional naval ship design application software with an expert system. Modeling techniques such as a spreadsheet, a database management system, and graphic display capability are incorporated as well. This DSS facilitates âwhatâifâ analysis of design problems and assessment of the tradeâoffs between performance and cost. The DSS will aid rapid generation of design alternatives and facilitate their evaluation. A final recommendation is made based on multiattribute decision analysis using the straightforward points allocation method and the analytic hierarchy process. During a typical consultation process, the user is prompted for inputs to the naval ship design process and is provided with a wide range of reports in graphical and numerical form. During a structured system evaluation, the DSS displayed considerable accuracy, flexibility, speed, userâfriendliness, and costâeffectiveness. The reliability and validity of the system were also confirmed. These evaluation procedures provide a replicable methodology for verification and validation of this type of AIâbased decision support system. Â© 1992 by the American Society of Naval Engineers

AB  - As it develops, artificial intelligence technology will have an increasing impact on building operations. This article focuses on: design; commissioning; diagnostics, operations and maintenance; training; and building and data management. Technologies that will affect these areas include expert systems, neural networks, intelligent computer aided design (ICAD), fuzzy logic and artificial reality. Expert systems are computer programs that mimic a human expert. Neural networks are computer programs that are designed to operate the way neurons operate in humans. Fuzzy logic is useful when the correct response is somewhere between a yes or a no because it can represent concepts such as almost, all, most and others. Artificial reality is a technology that allows users to project themselves into a computer generated 3-D simulation.

AB  - We describe the emerging area of artificial intelligence research on "knowledge compilation," the transformation of explicitly represented knowledge about a domain into an efficient algorithm for performing some task in that domain. In particular, we are interested in the case where the task is design synthesis. We survey several research projects based on this approach, and we use an example of geartrain design from the DIOGENES project to illustrate it in detail. We assess the potential of this approach for improving computer-aided design and identify some of the obstacles that knowledge compilation will have to overcome first.

AB  - Knowledge-based expert systems (KBES) have generated a great deal of excitement in the engineering community. Many civil engineering applications have been identified. Recent developments in the wind engineering field include WINDLOADER and WISER. Wind-induced damage assessment is also under investigation. Because many of the design and analysis problems facing wind engineers are ill structured, it is anticipated that expert systems will play an important role in the wind engineering field in the next decade. The objective of this paper is to explore the use of expert systems in wind engineering. Â© 1990.

AB  - Studies indicate that a significant portion of all mining machine failures are associated with electrical system problems. As more highly automated machines are developed, the complexity of a machineâs electrical control system can be expected to increase considerably, requiring a greater degree of skill and experience on the part of mine maintenance personnel. Knowledge-based expert diagnostic systems can provide a powerful method of improving equipment maintenance by quickly diagnosing control circuit malfunctions and recommending appropriate repair procedures. To investigate the applicability of expert systems in the area of control circuit diagnostics, the Bureau of Mines has developed a knowledge-based system to diagnose component malfunctions in the electrical control circuit of a continuous mining machine. The system leads the user through the appropriate procedures required to quickly identify the faulty control circuit component. Graphical displays are incorporated within the system to assist the user in locating the various components and test points. Once the faulty component has been isolated, the system is capable of accessing a database which can provide mine personnel with information concerning specific component part numbers and the availability and location of spare parts. The expert system development tool used to build the system, the structure and development of the knowledge base, and the software used to implement the graphical displays and equipment database, is discussed.

AB  - The dynamic behaviour of generalized cellular neural networks was studied. First a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium for the generalized cellar neural networks with delay was established using the degree theory. Then new conditions which guarantee the global exponential stability of the equilibrium for the generalized cellular neural networks with delay were given.

AB  - An overview of modern artificial intelligence-based techniques for processing heuristic knowledge is presented. Basic definitions and comparison with classical mathematical tools are given. A qualitative symptom observer is suggested as a replacement for an analytical symptom generator in some particular situations (complex system, unknown process model, etc.). All that led to the idea of an integrated fault diagnostic system dealing with as many information sources as possible: measured signals, observed parameters, quantitative and qualitative models and statistical data.

AB  - The Rate Monotonic Analysis (RMA) technique is one way to guarantee that all processes can be scheduled. This article discusses a case study where RMA was used as a tool to resolve real-time scheduling and processing issues associated with adding autonomous fault isolation and recovery software to previously developed flight software. The combined software system was then successfully tested on a real-time tested.

AB  - In concurrent engineering (CE), an attempt is made to perform design activities simultaneously rather than in series as in the case of traditional design processes. The theoretical benefits of this concurrent approach are a reduction of the duration of the design project, cost savings, and better quality of the final design. Practical implementations of CE in industry indicate that successfully managing the CE design process to achieve these goals will require advanced techniques and tools. A framework for a multiagent distributed system that supports analysis, planning and scheduling in order to provide coordination and control of the design process in a CE design environment is proposed. The ultimate goal of the envisaged framework is to provide engineering management with a design process planning software application which utilizes multiagent distributed systems (MADS) integrated to other knowledge sources (agents) by means of a blackboard-based architecture.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies include artificial neural networks, expert systems, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms. Their underlying methods differ from conventional computing and include concepts that simulate the way humans solve problems or how processes work in nature. These techniques are intended to tackle highly complex, nonlinear problems beyond the capability of conventional methods, or too costly or time consuming for them. AI methods are also controversial due to their nature and have not been fully accepted by some proponents of conventional approaches. Today, however, AI methods are closer to the mainstream as an extra tool for the control engineer. Some insight on the various AI techniques are discussed.

AB  - Psychologists and psychology students (n = 138) were provided an artificial-intelligence program that simulated a date rape client's responses to typed questions. Participants were asked to conduct a "clinical interview" by typing in their questions. Clinical experience was unrelated to participants' levels of confidence, perceived expertise, and efficiency in generating or analyzing questions. Both experience and academic level of training, however, affected participant's mode of questioning.

AB  - Workers in cognitive science and artificial intelligence assume that everything of importance to our intelligent functioning can be found inside the heads of individuals. This article takes a different approach. The nature of our disorderly, everyday, dialogical activities is first outlined, because it assumes that it is only in terms of this usually unnoticed background activity that we make sense of everything individual and distinctive we do in relation both to each other and to our larger surroundings: We constitute what we are pleased to call our individual minds and our world within it. Furthermore, it is in the unique variations that we each introduce into this constitutive activity that we can express ourselves, our own âinner lives.â Studies in cognitive science and artificial intelligence lead us not only to ignore these backgrounds but to institute forms of human relation leading to their eradication.

AB  - Production systems are ordered sets of if-then rules linking knowledge and action. The authors show how these systems, developed and applied in artificial intelligence and cognitive science, can be used to construct empirically based symbolic interactionist models of situated human interaction. The authors argue that production system models enhance the conceptual clarity and formal analytic capabilities of key ideas in Herbert Blumer's methodological directives for sociology's symbolic interactionist perspective. The authors present both a general discussion and outline of production system model building and a case study in which they evaluate a model for the detailed analysis of customer-waitperson interactions in a restaurant setting.

AB  - A NEW adaptive computerized instruction authoring system, called MediaMatrix, requires that content developers adhere to a wide variety of learning principles as they aspire to accomplish outcome learning goals which include not only the acquisition of specific content, but also the development of general comprehension and problem solving skills. This authoring system was designed for development of final products which include those referred to as Hypermedia Teaching-Learning Resource Libraries. These libraries are conceived as being not only a replacement for such traditional teaching resources as transparencies, notes, videos, laboratory exercises, and tests; they also are envisioned as replacing such student resources as the traditional textbook, study guides, and human tutors. By incorporating several artificial intelligence engines and knowledge generation systems, MediaMatrix enables developers to build adaptive programmed instruction and adaptive testing systems with comparative ease. This authoring environment allows developers to focus simultaneously on the systematic improvement of comprehension and problem solving skills while also providing for adaptive content presentations that change delivery rates to accommodate varying rates of learning. As students learn new material, the system not only learns what they know, but also the rate at which they are learning it. It then adapts instructional content delivery and testing to best meet the need of learners. Â© 1995, Springer. All rights reserved.

AB  - I argue that expertise is `constitutively social.' By that I mean not merely that expert skills require specialized training or that these skills apply only in some settings and not others. In addition, I mean to argue that expertise is constituted by the distribution of (human or machine) agents who have access to the skills and the mode of agent interaction. If certain skills are too readily available or the skilled agents are too contentious, then the expertise in question is eroded. Conversely, expertise can be solidified by making the skills scarce or by encouraging collegial relations among the skilled agents. An important consequence of this thesis is that knowledge engineers may erode expertise by proliferating expert systems. Under the right circumstances, however, this could lead to democratic empowerment. Nevertheless, it raises the general question of whether there are forms of knowledge that escape the political economy of expertise described in this paper. While I am prepared to be open-minded, the trend toward conceptualizing scientific products and processes as `intellectual property' leaves me skeptical.

AB  - Fuzzy logic is increasingly being incorporated in systems to provide robust and effective control in a wide range of applications. The method is based on a many-valued logic which enables general principles and expert knowledge to be used to provide control rules and procedures. This article explains the principles of fuzzy logic control, illustrating the ideas with simulations of examples of linear and non-linear control.

AB  - The application virtual reality (VR) is expanding into the enhancement of product design. With VR, the need for expensive time-consuming physical mockups becomes unnecessary. Unlike the standard CAD, VR can also immerse users into a computer-generated 'world' where they can interact with objects while within a design. Simultaneous solutions to a problem can be derived without the need for a physical prototype. Presently, VR is not being utilized as a next-generation drafting system. VR is facilitating other aspects of the design process such as fleshing out initial concepts; examining stress, aerodynamics, and other factors; monitoring ergonomics; and designing for maintainability.

AB  - This paper presents the design and implementation of an intelligent controller intended for use in distribution substations to perform monitoring and control duties within the framework of distribution automation needs. The hardware of the developed controller is a DOS based industrial computer running on ECB-BUS. The application software handles all input/ output tasks, data collection, manipulation and control decisions with its flexible structure. This embedded controller measures bus voltage, transformer and feeder currents and calculates the real and reactive power, power factor, frequency, and total harmonic distortion of voltage and current. In addition to its local and remote data acquisition and monitoring functions by means of console and SCADA outputs, the system, through its relay outputs, is capable of performing automation tasks such as integrated Volt/Var control, overload and underfrequency detection and load shedding at the substation level. This reliable, high capacity and low cost system is completely programmable so that it can handle new requirements with new configurations easily. Â© 1993 IEEE.

AB  - We present a system that generates explanations and tutorial problems from the probabilistic information contained in Bayesian belief networks. BANTER is a tool for high-level interaction with any Bayesian network whose nodes can be classified as hypotheses, observations, and diagnostic procedures. Users need no knowledge of Bayesian networks, only familiarity with the particular domain and an elementary understanding of probability. Users can query the knowledge base, identify optimal diagnostic procedures, and request explanations. We describe BANTER's algorithms and illustrate its application to an existing medical model.

AB  - Most care-giver "knowledge" needs arise at the point of care and are "patient-centered." Many of these knowledge needs can be met using existing on-line knowledge sources, but the process is too time-consuming, currently, for even the computer-proficient. We are developing a set of public domain standards aimed at bringing potentially relevant knowledge to the point of care in a straight-forward and timely fashion. The standards will a) make use of selected items from a Computer-based Patient Record (CPR), e.g., a diagnosis and measure of severity, b) anticipate certain care-giver knowledge needs, e.g., "therapy," "protocols," "complications," and c) try to satisfy those needs from available knowledge sources, e.g., knowledge-bases, citation databases, practice guidelines, and on-line textbooks. The standards will use templates, i.e., fill-in-the-blank structures, to anticipate knowledge needs and UMLS Metathesaurus enhancements to represent the content of knowledge sources. Together, the standards will form the specification for a "Knowledge-Server" (KS) designed to be accessed from any CPR system. Plans are in place to test an interim version of this specification in the context of medical oncology. We are accumulating anecdotal evidence that a KS operating in conjunction with a CPR is much more compelling to users than either a CPR or a KS operating alone.

AB  - The decision-making process in any environment, including the library, is potentially subjective and arbitrary. The impetus for this research has been to eliminate the discretionary component in vendor selection by designing a quantitative decision-making model. Technically, the model is based on the artificial intelligence concept known as an expert system. The model uses rules provided by the expert, policies of the individual institution, and quantitative decision techniques to assign orders to vendors. Advantages to this knowledge-based model are the following: (1) assurance of quantitative objectivity; (2) efficient allocation of limited resources; (3) improved use of personnel time; (4) creation of a database of vendor price structuring; and (5) usefulness as a training resource.

AB  - This article reformulates the Reiter logic-based, A theory of diagnosis from first principles, in a systems theory framework and extends it to explicitly cover admissible fault models. The reformulation allows us to use straightforward set theoretic and algebraic concepts to characterize the main theorem relating diagnoses and conflict sets. We distinguish between weak and strong diagnoses and show that nonminimal strong diagnoses (multiple faults) may arise where the class of admissible fault models of components is restricted. We argue that the effectiveness of troubleshooting may be greatly enhanced by taking such diagnoses into account. This is true since the nature of the admissible fault model classes can dramatically affect the diagnoses generated. In particular, diagnoses that are not based on models of potential fault behaviors may be quite deceptive in relation to actual failed system behavior. The full family of strong diagnoses, although potentially much more computationally demanding than the minimal diagnoses, should be taken as the basis for troubleshooting. Â© 1992 IEEE

AB  - Until now, the manufacturers of control systems have not agreed on a standard high-speed data highway system. Currently, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), in conjunction with several electric utilities and equipment manufacturers, is working on developing a standard protocol for communicating between various manufacturers' control systems. This is because future control room designs will require that more of the control and display functions be accessible from the control room through the CRTs. There will be less emphasis on traditional hard-wired control panels. EPRI states that the trend in the 1980s was toward advancement of microprocessor-based distributed control systems, while the trend in the '90s will be toward integrated plant monitoring and control systems. The development of such systems will be facilitated with the aid of human factors engineering, taking into account human factor inputs in the integration of computer-based workstations into power plant control rooms.

AB  - QMR-KAT is a computer-based tool which assists physicians in the construction of the QMR medical knowledge base. Each QMR disease profile results from an in-depth analysis of the published medical literature, and from consultations with expert clinicians. QMR-KAT is an interactive knowledge acquisition program which facilitates the creation of new disease profiles, records the supporting evidence for each disease profile entry, and enforces consistency with the existing knowledge base. The program has been used in the creation of all new QMR disease profiles over the past two years. It has also been used to support a study on the reproducibility of knowledge base construction.

AB  - This paper presents a set of studies in full mission simulation and the development of a predictive computational model of human performance in control of complex airspace operations. NASA and the FAA have initiated programs of research and development to provide flight crew, airline operations and air traffic managers with automation aids to increase capacity in enroute and terminal area to support the goals of safe, flexible, predictable and efficient operations. In support of these developments, we present a computational model to aid design that includes representation of multiple cognitive agents (both human operators and intelligent aiding systems). The demands of air traffic management require representation of many intelligent agents sharing world-models, coordinating action/intention, and scheduling goals and actions in a potentially unpredictable world of operations. The operator-model structure includes attention functions, action priority, and situation assessment. The cognitive model has been expanded to include working memory operations including retrieval from long-term store, and interference. The operator's activity structures have been developed to provide for anticipation through knowledge of the intention and action of remote operators. System stability and operator actions can be predicted by using the model. The model's predictive accuracy was verified using the full-mission simulation data of commercial flight deck operations with advanced air traffic management techniques.

AB  - Process 'learning' by way of neural networks (NWs) can be employed in the foundry industry, adapting the concept to foundry variables. At John Deere Foundry Waterloo, a new arc furnace controller known as the Intelligent Arc Furnace (IAF) was tested for its ability to address problems associated with impedance regulators. The IAF integrates high-speed digital monitoring of the arc furnace electrical characteristics with NWs to predict the future state of the furnace and then take action to avoid that state, if undesirable.

AB  - This paper addresses the optimum design of axially loaded non-prismatic steel columns, in which the objective is to minimize their volume under a given load by changing their shape, and assuming that are subject to buckling and strength constraints. We use a genetic algorithm (GA) to move through the search space of possible column designs, and choose the best one. Several issues arise when using the GA, such as how to decide which is the most appropriate representation scheme and how to fine tune its parameters. Both floating point and binary representation (with and without Gray coding) were used and compared to a more traditional optimization technique based on the generalized reduced gradient method. Our results show that the floating point representation provides the best solutions overall, reducing the volume of the column up to 30% in some cases.

AB  - Applications of evolutionary computation paradigms are playing increasingly important roles in explanation facilities. Until now, these applications have primarily been in the area of artificial neural network diagnostic systems. This paper explores the application of evolutionary computation to explanation facilities, both in numerics-based systems such as artificial neural networks and in symbolics-based applications such as expert systems. Differences in requirements for symbolics and numerics systems are briefly reviewed, as the similarities. Ways in which more traditional approaches used in knowledge-based systems can be combined with evolutionary computation tools to produce improved explanation facilities for hybrid and computational intelligence systems are suggested.

AB  - This paper consists of two parts. While the first part shows the application of artificial neural networks to load forecasting using new input-output models, the second part utilizes the results from the first part in unit commitment. Based on the forecasts provided, unit commitment schedules are obtained for both hourly and daily load variations. Issues related to both problems are discussed along with an illustration of the two-step method using data obtained from a local utility. While a generation schedule such as this is not only invaluable to power system planners and operators, it is shown that this two-step process paves the way for an artificial intelligence (AI) type of method for the unit commitment problem based on the same inputs as the load forecasting method. For the chosen inputs, the simulations here show an average error of 4.3% and 3.1% in the case of the daily (twenty-four hours ahead) and hourly (one hour ahead) load forecast, respectively. Â© 1995.

AB  - We designed and implemented an intelligent reflecting 2 Ã 1 photonic switch using polarization-selective birefringent computer-generated holograms combined with two polarization modulators. In functional terms, the reflecting switch provides a through path to the output when only one incoming link is transmitting. When both incoming links attempt transmission, the switch turns reflecting, thereby permitting a full exchange of the two incoming streams. The switch can also be set to detect backpropagating beams at its output, to split the beam evenly, and to route the two resulting beams to each of the two inputs. The switch is useful for ultrafast fault-tolerant photonic network applications. Â© 1995, Optical Society of America.

AB  - Multimedia uses electronic technology to integrate the power of computing with potentials offered by media such as full-motion video, sound, text, graphics, and animation. The use of interactive multimedia technology allows developers to take advantage of the flexibility, effectiveness, and innovations in a number of technologies to produce tools to enhance the teaching and learning process in a variety of fields. Multimedia programs have the potential to help produce cost effective training tools by avoiding expensive and repetitive procedures which require time, equipment, and other resources. They also can reduce unnecessary risk to personnel and waste of materials.

AB  - A computer-based decision support system called RiceFertility has been developed to provide information and recommendations on efficient utilization of fertilizer for the production of flooded rice in Arkansas. Conventional information sources regarding timing and rate of fertilizer applications were consolidated in developing a computer-based tool that generated recommendations quickly for many situations. The text of each recommendation was formulated to be sensitive to the tactical context of the individual problem scenario. The inputs to the expert system included cultural system, rice cultivar, rice growth stage, flood status, soil texture, and soil pH. Appropriate recommendations were generated for rates of early nitrogen (N), maximum tillering N, midseason N, and other soil fertility problems involving salinity, liming, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, and/or sulfur. The system logic was successfully validated in 29 of 31 sample scenarios tested. The set of sample scenarios was defined using the Arkansas Rice Research Verification Trials as a balanced source of fertilizer decisions made in growers' fields. A method of classifying the results of the validation testing was useful in evaluating the software.

AB  - The Mayo Clinic has a long tradition of indexing patient records in high resolution and volume. Several algorithms have been developed which promise to help human coders in the classification process. We evaluate variations on code browsers and free text indexing systems with respect to their speed and error rates in our production environment. The more sophisticated indexing systems save measurable time in the coding process, but suffer from incompleteness which requires a back-up system or human verification. Expert Network does the best job of rank ordering clinical text, potentially enabling the creation of thresholds for the pass through of computer coded data without human review.

AB  - We describe a librarian knowledge-based system that generates a search strategy from a query representation based on a user's information need. Together with the natural language parser AQUA, the system functions as a human/computer interface, which translates a user query from free text into a BRS Onsite search formulation, for searching the MEDLINE bibliographic database. In the system, conceptual graphs are used to represent the user's information need. The UMLS Metathesaurus and Semantic Net are used as the key knowledge sources in building the knowledge base.

AB  - This paper describes a system designed for air traffic control (ATC) training. The system consists of a computer simulation of an ATC radar workstation, a computer model of an ATC expert and other components that allow for automatic evaluation and âcoachingâ of an ATC student The rationale for such a system is presented, along with a discussion of computer âintelligentâ training methodologies. The architectural design of the system is described and those design features implemented in the current version of the system are discussed. Finally, there is a discussion of current and future research and system development: ideas for incorporating intelligent tutoring into the system software, techniques to be used by the system in evaluating student performance, and parameters and metrics to be used in generating ATC training exercises.

AB  - Qualitative models of dynamical systems fall into non-causal or causal approaches. The non-causal approach is widely used in part because traditional physics describes phenomena by means of symmetric functional relations. It supports the idea that causality can be ignored or inferred from the model itself. Nevertheless, when people explain how things work, they use causal relations. Representing causality explicitly makes it possible to take advantage of exogenous knowledge necessary for understanding the phenomena and supporting self-explanatory simulation. The basic concepts used in both approaches, in addition to the representation formalisms and algorithms, are discussed in the light of recent works performed by teams affiliated to the MQ&D research group in France.

AB  - This is the second of two companion papers dealing with distributed planning for air-traffic control. Three different organizational structures have been implemented: The local centralized architecture, and location-centered cooperative planning system with one- and two-level coordinator-coworker hierarchies. We present an initial, simplified analysis of the speedup obtainable by using the latter two organizational structures. The vehicle of our empirical studies, the distributed air-traffic control test bed is then introduced. We discuss the design and the results of a series of experiments performed. We compare in the test-bed performance measures of the three systems using the respective organizational structures. The comparisons are made at different levels of traffic density and problem size, in terms of communication overhead and processing time needed for planning. Â© ASCE.

AB  - The present paper introduces some basic concepts and terminology of distributed planning, and describes a novel coordinator-coworker structure--a control mechanism that can dynamically reorganize the planning system in response to the tasks at hand. Coordinators get either self-appointed in unambiguous situations or selected through a unique and inexpensiven omination/confirmationp rocess. The matching of tasks and coworkers is accomplished with minimum message passing and processing, by using appropriate meta-knowledge about the status of the network of nodes. Connections can be initiated by both coordinators and coworkers, leading to optimum load balancing. A hierarchically organized set of distributed scratch pads supports the coordinator-coworker mechanism. It is the medium for information exchange and also provides the basis for self-repairing in a graceful degradation mode whenever individual nodes become inoperational. We discuss the problems of air-traffic control and describe the kernel design of the airborne processors in a location-centered cooperative planning system. Finally, we explain the simulation-based planning process and its timing and selection considerations. A companion paper follows in the journal. Â© ASCE.

AB  - The generation expansion planning problem is a large-scale decision-making problem that depends throughout its intellectual process to a large degree on the planner's experience. To emulate the experience gained in the field of generation expansion planning, one of the artificial intelligence techniques, called an expert system, is applied. An integrated expert system is built to solve the problem of generation expansion planning. The expert system consists of two main modules: the shell and the knowledge base. This paper presents a description of the knowledge base module which consists of facts and production rules (IF-THEN structure). The knowledge base developed represents the planning state space including the uncertainties, search technique, heuristic estimates to guide the search process, problem reduction concepts, and empirical rules that represent human expertise. It generates a variety of recommended strategies under different scenarios. Â© 1992.

AB  - The subperiosteal implant has long been regarded as the most successful, predictable, and versatile of all implant systems. In some cases, however, anatomic morphology and surgical technique present certain limitations for the subperiosteal procedure. Through CAD/CAM multiplanar diagnostic imaging, not only have we been able to eliminate the first stage of the surgical procedure, but we have expanded the capabilities and versatility of the subperiosteal procedure. In addition, coating the subperiosteal implant frame with hydroxyapatite has allowed the achievement of bony union, thus increasing the long-range prognosis of the individual case.

AB  - Contemporary cardiac arrhythmia monitors, used commonly in intensive care settings, are highly sensitive to artifact, resulting in high false alarm rates, inability to detect P waves reliably, and crude rhythm interpretation. We report on two new approaches that address these problems: a noise preprocessor that characterizes the type and degree of artifact in an ECG, and a model-based rhythm interpretation algorithm.

AB  - A pattern recognition algorithm has been developed for systematic generation of shallow knowledge for nuclear power plant transient diagnostics. The algorithm involves feature selection and pattern discovery. The selection of N best features is attained by discarding redundant and nondiscriminatory features. An entropy minimax algorithm is used to discover the patterns by searching an N-dimensional feature space, populated with transient events of the data base, to locate subspaces that discriminate among the event classes. These patterns are then represented as production rules for diagnostics. A series of approximations have been implemented in the algorithm to handle the discovery of patterns in multidimensional space. We have also developed a perturbation algorithm within the entropy minimax framework to update the patterns in an incremental fashion as new data are obtained. The Midland Nuclear Power Plant Unit 2 simulator is used to generate 144 single-failure events. Based on these events, 25 production rules are generated, representing a two-level hierarchical knowledge structure of single-failure events along the critical safety function approach. These rules represent the common characteristics of time-varying features over the diagnostic time, thereby providing diagnostic capability at any time during the transient.

AB  - There are approximately 565,000 steel bridges in the United States. Of these, over 50 percent are more than 30 years old, and a large number are considered to be in a deteriorating condition. To demonstrate the feasibility of developing an integrated engineering training aid for bridge inspection and remedial actions, a prototype development project was undertaken at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC) in McLean, Virginia, under the Grants for Research Fellowships program of the National Highway Institute. The prototype expert system is called FASTBRID (Fatigue Assessment of Steel BRIDges). The development of the expert system/training aid was planned in two stages: development of a microcomputer-based prototype expert system that conforms with FHWA guidelines, and validation of the finished system in preparation for wide distribution.

AB  - Abstract. This paper offers a survey of the current state of Artificial Intelligence and Law, and makes recommendations for future research. Two main areas of investigation are discussed: the practical work on intelligent legal information systems, and the theoretical work on computational models of legal reasoning. In both areas, the knowledge representation problem is identified as the most important issue facing this field. Copyright Â© 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Artificial intelligence has been emerging as one of the fastest growing technologies during the past five years. One subset of this discipline that has experienced phenomenal growth, when measured by spending levels by the commercial sector and all levels of government, is that of Expert Systems. The development of Expert Systems applications for shipping operations has also been growing, albeit at a somewhat slower rate. However, a number of very innovative systems are nearing completion in the United States, as well as in Europe and Asia, that will radically change how vessels are operated and managed. This paper provides an overview of Expert Systems concepts, a discussion of the Maritime Administration's program of research and implementation of this technology, and a review of systems and other projects that are nearing completion in the United States as well as abroad. The paper concludes with prospects for future development of Expert Systems as the merchant fleets of the world look for ways to improve their competitiveness.

AB  - PYTHON is an expert system for recognizing and performing squeeze plays, an advanced strategy in the game of bridge. It performs, in its limited domain, at a truly expert standard, comparable to players of national ranking. The development of PYTHON illustrates how a well-constructed logical solution to a simple case of a problem can be extended in several different directions, yielding new results and a powerful program. PYTHON's core recognizes when a simple squeeze exists according to well-established theory. The core was extended to handle more complicated squeezes, also described by theory, making PYTHON's performance truly expert. The core was also extended to generate a plan for playing squeezes which has been successfully executed by a separate bridge-playing program. Finally, methods were added for recognizing and executing squeezes not covered by existing theory, by analogy with the other methods. Â© 1990.

AB  - Expert knowledge is a resource. The development of expert systems technology has helped us to appreciate the value of expert knowledge. The discipline of knowledge engineering can guide us in identifying, eliciting, codifying, and applying this resource. However, expert systems can address only a subset of expert knowledge. This discipline of knowledge engineering must develop newer and broader tools that are not necessarily computer-based. The benefit of knowledge engineering is the efficient preservation and transfer of expertise within and between organizations, with implications for enhancing training and technology transfer.

AB  - The development of sound routing strategies for dynamic traffic routing is a complex task that requires the use of an automated traffic-routing decision support system (DSS). In this study, heuristic search algorithms were used to build prototype DSSs for on-line traffic routing. Specifically, two DSSs were developed for a real-world highway network: the first was developed by using simulated annealing (SA) and the second was constructed by using genetic algorithms (GAs). The use of such algorithms allows more accurate modeling of traffic dynamics than is possible by traditional analytical techniques. To evaluate and compare the performances of the developed DSSs, a test set consisting of 10 randomly generated problems was used. Results demonstrated that the DSSs are capable of yielding high-quality solutions in a reasonable amount of time. In addition, for on-line traffic routing, SA tends to perform better than GAs.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate subjective aspects from questionnaires dealing with dental trauma by applying different computerized inductive techniques within the field of artificial intelligence to questionnaires consisting of descriptive variables and of questions reflecting functional, personal, and social effects of patients' oral situation following dental trauma. As the methodology used is new to many readers in odontologie sciences, a detailed description of both the processes and the terminology is given. Utilizing a neural network as a first step in an analysis of data showed if relations existed in the training set, but the network could not make the relations explicit, so other methods, inductive methods, had to be applied. Inductive methods have the potential constructing rules from a set of examples. The rules combined with domain knowledge can reveal relations between the variables. It can be concluded that the usage of methods based on artificial intelligence can greatly improve explanatory value and make knowledge in databases explicit.

AB  - As increasingly sophisticated routing, navigation and trip-planning devices are installed in automobiles, it becomes necessary to consider the likely effects of such devices on overall traffic system performance. A simple simulation model of "rush-hour" commuting is presented and the system-level consequences of a variety of agent-level behavior patterns are explored. In the context of this model, increasingly sophisticated agent-level commuting strategies result in decreased system-level performance as measured by several criteria.

AB  - This paper presents a knowledge-based system methodology, called Domain Knowledge Transformation (DKT), that can be used at the conceptual design stage of mechanical systems. The DKT model is a two-levels process that reveals the insights of the methodology. In the first level, defined as the preconcept level, a list of design specifications is developed through the interaction between an intelligent system and the users or customers. In the second level, defined as the concept level, design solutions are generated using a functional requirements mapping (FRM) method. Design using FRM is characterized by the ability to structure hybrid sets of design knowledge, relevant information and customer needs. FRM method define results of current design efforts, future tasks and their priorities, various metrics, and a presentation format for decision making. After briefly introducing the DKT methodology, the paper shows how design requirements are generated and stored by questions and answers interface, objective tree guided structured interview and the dynamic knowledge base in the preconcept level. The paper then shows, through a real world design example, how FRM can be used to provide a detailed association between statements of design requirements (customer needs) and the physical entities proposed as solutions. The paper concludes that DKT methodology could be a useful concurrent engineering tool in the early design stage.

AB  - Two major developments in advanced elevator technology are described. These are new elevator drives and various applications of artificial intelligence with respect to six categories: simulation and modeling, digital monitoring and the four aspects of supervisory control, namely, expert system-based, fuzzy logic-based, computer vision-based and artificial neural network-based. As buildings with more than 100 storeys and heights climbing to as high as 4,000 m, it is anticipated that advanced elevator technology will become more popular and the existence of very high speed drives and artificial intelligence in every control module inside every building's vertical transportation system is not too exaggerated.

AB  - Economics has been slow to yield to artificial intelligence techniques, although the potential value of these techniques has been recognized repeatedly. This potential is examined in the case of advanced symbolic and visual techniques for qualitatively reasoning about complex dynamic systems. Application of these techniques to the study of dynamic economic systems however requires their adaptation to economics problems so as to take account of the significant contribution that mathematical economics has made to the study of dynamics, especially through exploitation of the idiosyncratic structure of many economic systems. Possible implications of using these techniques in related areas, such econometrics, are outlined as well.

AB  - Researchers at the US Bureau of Mines have combined several biologically oriented techniques into a comprehensive approach to adaptive process control. The three specific techniques from the field of artificial intelligence used to produce the adaptive process control systems are: (1) fuzzy logic, (2) genetic algorithms, and (3) neural networks. Fuzzy logic is a technique in which the human 'rule-of-thumb' approach to decision making is modelled. Genetic algorithms are search algorithms based on the mechanics of natural genetics that are able to rapidly locate near-optimum solutions to difficult problems. Neural networks are crude paradigms of the mammalian brain that have been used to model industrial systems. The paper provides an overview of the architecture used to achieve adaptive process control, and demonstrates its effectiveness in the control of three industrial systems: (1) a titration system, (2) an exothermic chemical reaction, and (3) a column flotation unit.

AB  - SHAPES, an artificial intelligence-based machine-learning thermal-generator scheduling system, for the run-up-to-peak period, has been developed as an extension of earlier works on a heuristic-guided depth-first scheduling algorithm. SHAPES incorporates new machine-learning algorithms, capable of automatically acquiring heuristic-search guidance, alleviating the need for heuristics to be manually provided to the original scheduling algorithm. Further enhancements have also been introduced in the new system, through the use of best-first search to explore the problem space instead of depth-first search. The paper reports on the development of SHAPES, and application studies which have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of its learning subsystem in improving search efficiency, as well as the performance of the new system in relation to the original scheduling algorithm.

AB  - Process planning output can be post-processed into criteria for job scheduling decisions in printed circuit board assembly using surface-mount technology (SMT). Artificial intelligence-based techniques used in computerized planning and scheduling systems in other industries can be extended to printed circuit board operations. These techniques include blackboard architectures, object-oriented programming systems, and nonmonotonic reasoning systems. These techniques were used to demonstrate a unique architecture of blackboard systems that communicate via object-oriented messages to arrive at a shop-floor process plan and production schedule. The methodology was specialized to the assembly of printed circuit boards using surface-mounted components in a high-variety/low-volume product mix. The assembly facility was represented as a hierarchical object of product, process, and organizational knowledge. The system of working heuristics was integrated within a prototype environment with the practitioners that assisted in its development. The end result is a good working methodology for system development, implementation, and maintenance by knowledge worker involvement. Â© 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The major theme of Session B explored and assessed the current status of activity-classification (AC)1 and structure-activity-relationship (SAR) methods developed to model adverse health effects that can result when biological systems are exposed to various chemical substances. The output from such models is intended to be used as information that supports risk assessments performed on toxic substances. Speakers gave special attention to the requirements and applications of hazard identification models. Specific aspects of the broad subject matter were augmented and explicated by audience and panel discussions during the 1.5 days available. This format stimulated the exchange of a surprisingly broad range of information and stimulating ideas. In order to gather the diverse aspects of Session B in one place, the Rapporteurs agreed that this summary would aim at providing a comprehensive overview, while Dr. Feldman's would amplify selected points of general interest.

AB  - In a previous paper, 'Calculating the Centroid of a Fuzzy Logic Controller Using an Artificial Neural Net,' the author shows that fuzzy logic control is extremely robust. Also, in the previous paper, the RX net is described, and it is postulated that it would be possible to use this net to make calculations similar to those done by a fuzzy logic controller. The present paper shows how control was achieved with much less effort than had been suggested previously, and with a higher degree of accuracy than expected. Based on a theory of intelligence offered by Albus, this paper concludes with suggestions concerning how memory circuitry might have evolved from control circuitry.

AB  - Advances in artificial intelligence particularly neural network technology may provide an opportunity to enhance trending and diagnostic facilities for the gas-turbine engine of aircrafts. Current monitoring systems are labor-intensive, costly, provides limited and slow diagnosis of engine faults, and has an inadequate recording system. To address these issues, the US Air Force, for example, has launched the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology project. It is expected to sense more parameters but with minimal intrusion, weight addition and system complexity, thereby improving the comprehensiveness and value of engine health monitoring.

AB  - The introduction of computer-integrated manufacturing in ship production will involve more than linkage of separate automated ship production processes. It will create major changes from design through delivery. This paper presents the results from a three-part project: (1) a manufacturing literature survey of computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) and supporting technologies, (2) a National Science Foundation (NSF)-sponsored workshop on CIM in ship production, and (3) research and development recommendations to facilitate CIM in ship production.

AB  - Optical matrix-vector multiplication by using pinhole holograms fixed in a photorefractive crystal is experimentally demonstrated. This method offers the advantages of large holographic storage capacity and high-speed programmability. It can be useful in some expert systems that require only a finite number of large matrices to be updated quickly for high-speed matrix-vector multiplication. Â© 1994 Optical Society of America.

AB  - In the design procedure, mature designers always analyze and synthesize various requirements and conduct necessary information processing so as to nave the most suitable result. In order to rationally automatize such a synthetic procedure, it is necessary to effectively transplant the information processing function of the designer into a computer system. Thus, in this paper, a novel decision making methodology has been proposed to establish a future intelligent CAD system for the basic layout. The proposed methodology is based on the multiple-layered decision making with the transit evaluation function, and its validity has also been verified through case studies on the design of a main spindle system in machine tools.

AB  - Dentists frequently fail to provide dental technicians with the design information necessary for the construction of removable partial dentures. The computerization of dental practices and the development of appropriate knowledge-based systems could provide a powerful tool for improving this aspect of dental care. This article describes one such system currently under development which is an example of the kind of additional facility that will become available for those practices with the necessary hardware.

AB  - To build model-based systems capable of emulating the scientist's or engineer's way of reasoning about a given physical domain requires methods for automating the formulation or selection of a model which adequately captures the knowledge needed for solving a specific problem. To find and exploit such models requires the use and integration of different kinds of knowledge, formalisms and methods. This paper describes a system which aims at reasoning automatically about visco-elastic materials from a mechanical point of view. It integrates both domain-specific and domain-independent knowledge in order to classify and analyze the mechanical behaviour of materials. The classification task is based on qualitative knowledge, whereas the analysis of a material is performed at a quantitative level and is based on numerical simulation. The key ideas of the work are to automatically generate a library of models of ideal materials and their corresponding qualitative responses to standard experiments; to classify an actual material by selecting from within the library a class of models whose simulated qualitative behaviours towards standard loads match the observed behaviours; to identify a quantitative model of the material, and then to analyze the material by simulating its behaviour on any load. Each model in the library is automatically generated in two different forms; at the lowest level, as a symbolic description and, at a mathematical level, as an ordinary differential equation. This paper mainly concentrates on the methods and algorithms of model generation and qualitative simulation.

AB  - The guiding agenda of international programs promoting intelligent manufacturing systems (IMS) has been the creation of advanced machines with artificial intelligence capable of coping with the complex and changing conditions that threaten to disrupt the increasingly 'automatic' factory. This article argues that this needs to be broadened to incorporate the development of integrated sociotechnical production systems that effectively combine human and technical resources in creating 'smart' systems capable of adapting technologies to firm specific conditions, utilizing data bases, customizing software rules and procedures, and ensuring the ongoing development of the sociotechnical system. This requires greater attention to the human resources and organizational requirements of interdisciplinary system design and implementation. In making this argument, the article draws upon recent Australian case study experiences in the implementation and customization of integrated CAD/CAM systems and European research into human-centered CIM design.

AB  - System reliability is an important parameter in the operation of modern utility systems, spacecraft and manufacturing facilities. Over the last several decades researchers have used many different methods to determine complex system reliability. This paper uses new and novel techniques which are based on artificial intelligence and expert systems to determine system reliability. This work is based on heuristic search and a symbolic logic system which provides symbolic representation for overall system reliability when there is a single input and single output. Pivotal decomposition is used on a recursive basis to repeatedly reduce complex systems/subsystems to simpler systems. Eventually, these simpler systems are further reduced into easily resolved series-parallel arrangements. This symbolic logic system uses a heuristic based 'hill climbing' search algorithm. The algorithm identifies the pivotal or complex component. Once this pivotal component is selected, additional procedures are used to symbolically recognize other components within the resulting subgraphs which are made superfluous by the selection of the pivot component. These superfluous components are removed, and the simplification process is allowed to continue on a recursive basis. Once further recursive analysis is not needed, additional rules are employed to reduce the result to a system recognizable form in terms of series-parallel components. Finally, a 'symbolic processor' is used to convert this recognized form into a symbolic sum of products equation representing the overall system. Â© 1993.

AB  - RESUME is a system that performs temporal abstraction of time-stamped data. RESUME is based on a model of three temporal-abstraction mechanisms: point temporal abstraction (a mechanism for abstracting values of several parameters into a value of another parameter); temporal inference (a mechanism for inferring sound logical conclusions over a single interval or two meeting intervals); and temporal interpolation (a mechanism for bridging nonmeeting temporal intervals). Making explicit the knowledge required for temporal abstraction supports the acquisition of that knowledge.

AB  - The intensive care unit is set apart from other hospital patient care areas by (1) physiological instrumentation that permits better assessment and more effective therapy and (2) more intensive nursing. These capabilities allow nurse and physician intensivists to evaluate tissue perfusion and tissue oxygenation by the temporal patterns of oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption, as well as hemodynamics. Such evaluation provides important insight into the functional impairment of hemorrhagic, traumatic, septic, and postoperative shock. Using artificial intelligence-based systems, complex clinical algorithms--tailored to specific patient conditions--have been developed and are described. These algorithms are based on both invasive and noninvasive monitoring systems and on clinical experience with a large series of high-risk surgical patients.

AB  - In our model of a distributed information system, two information structures are maintained - the application database and the (routing) database used to route queries in a computer network. Any site of a distributed information system which does not understand some attribute values used in a query has to search for a site which can explain them. The information stored in routing database has a strong impact on the speed of this search. In [5], we propose that each site learns from its neighbors the descriptions of all unknown attribute values used in queries. These descriptions are represented in the form of rules and stored in dictionaries added to all sites of a distributed information system. This extended distributed system with dictionaries is called intelligent.

AB  - A distinction is drawn between the predicational and mediational models of human cognition. By predication, I mean an act of affirming, denying, or qualifying broader patterns of meaning in relation to narrower or targeted patterns of meaning. By mediation, I mean a form of explanation in which something that is taken in or input comes indirectly to play a role in a process that was not initially a part of this process. Oppositionality of meanings is fundamental to the predicational process. It is shown that George Kelly relied on a predicational model in his psychology of personal constructs. It is not possible to bring Kellyian and computer terminology together into one viewpoint because of this basic contradiction in the theory of human cognition. Â© 1991 Taylor 8 Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Radiotherapy treatment optimization is done by generating a set of tentative treatment plans, evaluating them and selecting the plan closest to achieving a set of conflicting treatment objectives. The evaluation of potential plans involves making tradeoffs among competing possible outcomes. Multiattribute decision theory provides a framework for specifying such tradeoffs and using them to select optimal actions. Using these concepts, we have developed a plan-ranking model which ranks a set of tentative treatment plans from best to worst. Heuristics are used to refine this model so that it reflects the clinical condition of the patient being treated and the practice preferences of the physician prescribing the treatment. A figure of merit is computed for each tentative plan, and is used to rank the plans. The approach described is very general and can be used for other medical domains having similar characteristics. The figure of merit can also be used as an objective function by computer programs that attempt to automatically generate an optimal treatment plan.

AB  - Basically, an assembly process is a sequence of positioning and fixing in position between the parts of the system to be assembled. However, finding this sequence automatically remains a very complex procedure because of the combinational aspect of the problem. The conventional programming methods of generating the ordered sequence cannot satisfy the modern factory requirements. The new approach, which seems more promising, considers artificial intelligence techniques and particularly the knowledge-based systems concept. This article presents the design of an expert system for assembly planning with a description of all its components.

AB  - In order to effectively organize the use of nursing time during clinic check-in, we designed a forward chaining rule based program for nursing history taking, problem tracking, and documentation. The program consists of a medical logic module trigger engine which identifies relevant rules for nursing history, an interactive question manager for nursing history taking, and a rule generation shell implemented within a specially designed Medical Query Language (MQL) shcema. At clinic check-in, the engine refreshes the rule set for the patient from interaction with the computerized medical record. The interaction driver assists the nurse with tracking of elapsed time, and allows him/her to pursue questions, record data, and create or complete nursing interventions. Nursing question sets and interventions are maintained longitudinally to assure continuity of care. Nursing problems are created on the problem list within the computerized record as the rule system identifies their existence.

AB  - In this article, we demonstrate that, by using a range of Al techniques, a specialised computer-aided design (CAD) tool can be created that enables users unskilled in instrumentation engineering to fully design and manufacture certain custom instruments. The prototype system ThermoShell produces a complete customised thermocouple installation to measure the temperature of a fluid moving in a pipe, a common measurement requirement in the process industries. The conception, implementation and operation of this system is described and the reaction of users is reported. The place of systems such as ThermoShell in the overall field of CAD of instrumentation is discussed, and the likely development paths are outlined in the light of user feedback.

AB  - Collision of vehicles with fixed objects adjacent to the roadway has been a concern of traffic engineers for many years. One solution to prevent or reduce the number of accidents of this type is to install a traffic barrier to shield the objects from being hit directly. However, because the barrier itself is a fixed object, the question is whether a barrier is more effective at a particular location than no barrier at all. If a barrier is needed, where should it be located and what type of barrier would satisfy the design criteria? Issues of this nature are ill-structured and difficult to address using normal computing technology since many factors contribute to the problem. For roadside safety, the primary factors are diverse and interrelated. This paper presents a demonstration prototype knowledge-based expert system (Roadside) for roadside-safety analysis. In particular, this system is developed to evaluate whether a traffic barrier is necessary for a particular site in analysis. Development of this demonstration prototype shows an expert-system approach for roadside safety analysis is feasible. The artificial-intelligence (AI) programming language Prolog is used for developing the system. The use of Prolog provides greater flexibility and adaptability in developing the system. However, much more programming time is required to develop the expert system. Â© ASCE.

AB  - This paper deals with the application of 'axiomatic' approach to the conceptual design of a hot rolling process. Functional requirements {FRs} of the rolling process are governed by the metallurgical and shape requirements of the product. Design parameters {DPs} which are capable of controlling the process in order to achieve the desired {FRs} are identified. A design matrix which relates {FRs} and {DPs} is then derived and re-arranged to maintain independency of the parameters and "decouple" the design. Results obtained using this approach will form a basis for subsequent, detailed design of the process. Â© 1991 CIRP.

AB  - Case-based reasoning (CBR) is an active area of research within artificial intelligence that emphasizes the function of memory in problem-solving. It proceeds from the premise that people cope with new problems or situations by reusing the strategies that have proved effective in similar situations in the past. Rather than deduction or the application of rules, the basic inferential process is that of recognition. Because the reasoning characteristic of politics is largely of this type, we suggest that the concepts and formalisms developed within this branch of artificial intelligence can be usefully applied to the study of political institutions and political behavior. But we argue, critically, that if CBR is to be applied to politics, it must be generalized to accommodate multiple agents who act repeatedly in multiple tasks. We outline what these extensions to CBR would involve, using the history of liability in tort law as a worked example. Â© 1990 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - The productivity of automated assembly systems is essentially determined by the reliability of the facilities and the quality of parts to be assembled. Fast process fault diagnosis is a precondition for reducing downtimes. Considerable knowledge on fault behaviour of automated assembly systems is obtained in phases of machine installation and of new product introduction. An expert system running on cell computer level has been realized to keep this knowledge and make it available for diagnosis in the shop floor. The paper describes architecture and implementation in a flexible automated assembly cell. Special reference is given to knowledge acquisition and structure, modification concept and user interface. Potentials and risks of the approach are evaluated. Â© 1990 CIRP.

AB  - The application of Artificial Intelligence for Knowledge Based Systems (KBS) is reviewed and applied to the basic power system network analysis problem. A frame based KBS has been developed to assist students to prepare data for power flow analysis. The present prototype for a Power Flow Knowledge Based System (PFKBS) is an example of a shallow knowledge system. The details of the implementations for an academic power system are used to highlight the differences between a frame based approach and a conventional FORTRAN approach. The data structures used within the developed frame based KBS are presented in sufficient detail for anyone to regenerate the data base. The user interface is illustrated for a small power system. The method of preparing data for the power flow as a sequence of knowledge bases is discussed for the example system. Â© 1990 IEEE

AB  - One of the difficult techniques of a remote sensing satellite is to make its attitude control system to a certain accuracy. Usually, the attitude of a satellite is determined by a single sensor. But in the case that a high accuracy of the attitude is required, we should use several sensors and integrate them in order to process their data. A BP neural network with a feedback loop was proposed and designed for the satellite attitude measurement system which consists of inertial sensors, infrared earth sensors and shadow of sun on the accuracy of the measurement system can be restrained. The accuracy of the measurement system is improved a lot.

AB  - In The End of Science, I argued that particle physics, cosmology, evolutionary biology, and other fields of pure science have entered an era of diminishing returns (Horgan, 1997). Although scientists will continue refining and extending current theories and applying their knowledge in the realms of technology and medicine, they may never again achieve insights into nature as profound as quantum mechanics, relativity theory, the big bang theory, natural selection, and DNA-based genetics. One reasonable objection to the book was that mind-related research, of all current scientific enterprises, has the most revolutionary potential, and it deserves a more thorough treatment than it received in The End of Science. I responded to this objection by writing a book that focused on "mind-science" (Horgan, 1999). The Undiscovered Mind considered not only the debate over consciousness, which was the primary focus of The End of Science; it also reviewed the record of fields such as clinical psychology, psychiatry, behavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. I contended that there has been little progress in understanding the mind, replicating its properties, or treating its disorders - especially compared with the extravagant claims made by proponents of certain approaches. In this article, I summarize some of my book's main points.

AB  - Over the past few years, our team has developed several computer-based models in the areas of architectural form-making and thermal analysis. These programs were designed to deal with specific problems and use a range of techniques including machine vision, knowledge-based systems, and artificial intelligence techniques. Recently, a project that integrates these systems was initiated. Its objective is to design an intelligent computer shell that forms the basis for this integration in the domain of architecture. The paper discusses the development of the shell and its use to analyze and study architectural form and its determinants. The shell accommodates modules that link the morphological structure of architectural design with more of its determinants (e.g., structural, acoustical, and lighting considerations, as well as code requirements). The paper presents and discusses the background of the shell, its structure, its methods of knowledge representation, and an example of its use.

AB  - The Army's Rotorcraft Pilot's Associate (RPA) program demonstrates knowledge based cognitive decision aiding (CDA) technology for existing and new helicopters. The RPA system uses symmetric multiprocessing software modules (agents) connected via a shared memory context model. To coordinate agents' modules and to provide real-time decision aiding, RPA uses a task network architecture (TNA) that includes run-time scheduling and dynamic task reallocation within a processor pool. The TNA is a software architecture or framework that supports the modeling of crew task activities, domain context, efficient prototyping, along with real-time operation in a multiprocessing system context. The TNA evolved from analysis and experience with the development and run-time requirements of the Air Force Pilot's Associate (PA) system, subsequent Army Day/Night Advanced Pilotage System, and present RPA system. The current implementation is implemented in C++ on Silicon Graphics symmetric multiprocessing system using six of twelve processors. TNA consists of the data structures and constructs that enhance the developers' capability to define and implement the functionality of associate systems. This paper describes the detailed design of the Task Network Architecture on the shared memory symmetric multiprocessing system.

AB  - A tool to support computer-aided conceptual design of mechatronic assemblies in a collaborative, multi-user environment is developed. Conceptual understanding and prototyping (CUP) allows a team of design engineers, collaborating over the Internet, to develop a high-level structure-behavior-function description of an assembly in a virtual reality modeling language (VRML)-based virtual environment. The goal is to enable users to navigate intricate product data management and cased-based design knowledge-bases, providing the ability to perform design at conceptual level and have intelligent CAD tools that can draw on details form large repositories of previously archived designs.

AB  - There are three main branches of artificial intelligence (AI): expert systems; fuzzy logic; and neural networks. The applications in the paper industry started in the late 80's and have picked up since then as better software and faster components became available. The general areas of application include: on-line control; on-line advice; and research. AI techniques can also be used for production scheduling and maintenance operations.

AB  - Abstracts or summary notes and automated summarization techniques would be highly useful if routinely applied to cataloging or metadata for Internet documents and documents in other databases. Information seekers need external summary information to assess content and value of retrieved documents. Traditional models for writers, in library audiovisual cataloging, journal databases and archival work are examined, along with innovative new model databases featuring robust cataloging summaries. Recent developments in automated techniques, computational research, and machine summarization of digital images are noted. Recommendations are made for future designers of cataloging and metadata standards. Â© 1997 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

AB  - Intelligent systems can now be implemented in a distributed way at the sensor level, as well as at the manufacturing execution system (MES) level. As industry seeks to achieve the goal of 'closing the loop' with enterprise business systems, it also will be necessary to embed intelligence throughout the distributed systems. Embedded intelligence at the sensor level will produce better measurements that are available for all higher-level operations. At the MES level, it will provide safer operations, better productivity, more consistent quality, and more flexibility.

AB  - As the costs associated with clinical research and new drug development increase, it is incumbent upon us to develop alternative research methodologies. A new Computer Intuition (CI) program identifies literature-based evidence with the potential to generate a hypothesis that is most likely to be clinically confirmed regarding the cause of a disease or the questions being posed. The objective of this study was to demonstrate whether computer intuition can be used to guide scientific research in solving important biomedical questions. The establishment of CI as an alternative research methodology has the potential to accelerate the translation of basic science findings into clinical practice. The specific aim of this study was to develop a CI-driven hypothesis related to the controversial issue debating which radiographic imaging technology is most suitable for diagnostic purposes prior to the placement of oral implants. This hypothesis was then compared, in retrospect, with a known opinion established following a recent literature review on this issue. In his review of the literature, Frederiksen (1995) suggests that multiplanar reformatted computed tomography (CT) is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice prior to implant placement. To compare the CI hypothesis with Frederiksen's (1995) opinion, we subjected 34 relevant papers to CI analysis. The output consisted of clusters of important statements, phrases, and thought processes from the given dataset rated with the greatest potential to generate testable hypotheses. Both CI's output and Frederiksen (1995) indicated that CT scanning is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice prior to implant placement. Although the ultimate utility of CI is dependent on the successful testing of its derived hypothesis, this preliminary retrospective study suggests that CI might be useful in guiding scientific research.

AB  - Sensors play an irreplaceable role as the sources of primary information on the object or process being measured. Any error or even malfunction in this part of the measuring chain has serious consequences and cannot usually be corrected in the later parts of a measuring system. In spite of this pessimistic outlook recent advances in sensors and measurement science offer some possibilities of increasing their accuracy and their general metrological parameters. The new approaches and concepts are based on the tendency to optimise a measuring system based on the criteria of cognitive aspects of the sensor output signals, automatic calibration, artificial intelligence and fusion of information from sensor arrays.

AB  - The paper presents an online adaptive artificial neural network (ANN) based power system stabilizer (PSS). The proposed controller is first trained offline using a pole placement based state feedback gain technique at different operating points. The trained ANN parameters (weights and biases) are updated and tuned online using the speed deviation as the reinforcement signal. The proposed PSS is tested at different operating conditions and a variety of regulator gains. The digital results validate the effectiveness and reliability of the new PSS in terms of fast system response under different loading conditions compared with the conventional PI controller and the modern control theory approach of pole placement.

AB  - A framework for an intelligent fusion of outputs from a combination of the state of the art nondestructive testing techniques of highway bridges and parking garages is described. A hybrid artificial intelligence system that automates the decision-making process is employed for the examination of the results obtained from various nondestructive testing methods. Neural networks, fuzzy logic, as well as other computational paradigms are employed for a preliminary pattern recognition and sensor data reduction from individual nondestructive testing techniques. An expert system is used for providing a user interface, selecting alternative paradigms for data analysis guided by the user input, as well as the information obtained from the system's knowledge base. The final decision-making process is performed via the expert system through the interpretation of the numerical results based on heuristic and knowledge-based reasoning. The system is divided into many independent modules that interact with each other. Any of the modules can be individually modified, retrained or replaced altogether without affecting any of the other modules.

AB  - The train formation plan is one of the most important elements of railroad system operations. Although mathematical programming formulations and algorithms are available for solving the train formation problem (TFP), the computational time required for their convergence is usually excessive. At the same time, shorter decision intervals are becoming necessary given the highly competitive operating climates of the railroad industry. Thus, new techniques are needed for generating efficient solutions for the TFP. In this study, we present the development of a genetic algorithm (GA) as a possible technique for this problem. The calibration and validation of the GA model are carried out for three different complexity levels of objective functions. It is found that the optimal solutions can be found for all the different formulations while consuming only a small amount of computation time.

AB  - Diagnostic expert systems are gaining acceptance among physicians. Recently, a comparative study of the performance of four major commercial diagnostic programs demonstrated that the information they produce contains a certain amount of irrelevancy that the trained physician ignores. Medical HouseCall is a consumer health information expert system based on a medical expert system for physicians, Iliad. To enhance the usefulness of Medical HouseCall to health care consumers, we are interested in significantly reducing the amount of irrelevancy contained in the diagnostic differential list. Testing with over 470 'textbook' cases revealed that a large part of the irrelevancy can be eliminated by adding universal and medical 'common sense' knowledge. Using four performance measures, we compared, on a subset of cases, the differential lists from two versions of the program: the refined knowledge base (1995) and an older version (1994) 'pre-common sense'. The results suggest that the performance of a diagnostic expert system can be significantly improved with the addition of common sense knowledge.

AB  - Differences in data definition between sites are a known obstacle to sharing of reminder-system rule sets. We identify another data characteristic--data accuracy--with implications for sharing. We reviewed the literature on data accuracy and found reports of high error rates for many data classes used by reminder systems (e.g., problem lists). The accuracy of other, equally important, data classes had not been characterized. Wide variations in accuracy between sites has been observed, suggesting that such differences may pose a previously unrecognized barrier to sharing of reminder rules. We propose a belief-network model for encoding reminder rules that explicitly models site-specific data accuracy and we discuss how encoding knowledge in this format may lower the cost and effort required to share reminder rules between sites.

AB  - The Heart Monitor is an object-oriented, knowledge-based system designed to support the clinical activities of cardiovascular (CV) rehabilitation. The original concept was developed as part of graduate research completed in 1992. This paper describes the second generation system which is being implemented in collaboration with a local heart rehabilitation program. The PC UNIX-based system supports an extensive patient database organized by clinical areas. In addition, a knowledge base is employed to monitor patient status. Rule-based automated reasoning is employed to assess risk factors contraindicative to exercise therapy and to monitor administrative and statutory requirements.

AB  - The most popular method for abstracting visual information from video images is based around image grabbing techniques. This is expensive, bulky and quite often too slow. It also requires the use of large amounts of processing power. There are a number of applications, ranging from intelligent toys to machine vision and security applications which need either low cost video images or ones that can be digitally manipulated. The main criteria for the camera described was its manufactured cost - below $20. It had to be easily mass produced and small enough to fit into mobile toys, such as radio controlled cars.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to present an evidence that cancer is a complex system, that future prognostic factors will be nonmonotonic and they will exhibit complex interactions. Because TNM staging systems do not give the desired accuracy, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were considered. It was shown that ANNs can perform as well as the best traditional prediction methods, and they can capture the power of nonmonotonic predictors and discover complex interactions.

AB  - A logarithmic barrier method is applied to the training of supervised feedforward artificial neural networks. A search direction is derived using a Quasi-Newton based algorithm that approximates the inverse of the Hessian of a logarithmic error function iteratively. By bounding the weights we ensure stability when we update the weights. Specifically, the Quasi-Newton barrier function method approach is incorporated into the back propagation scheme. It moves the weights on a trajectory in the interior of the feasible weight space and has good convergence properties. The barrier method is tested using a pattern recognition problem. It is shown that, the Quasi-Newton barrier function algorithm converges faster than the classical back propagation algorithm, especially for large scale problems.

AB  - When designing mechanisms, designers now can use computational tools to confirm kinematic behavior of mechanisms after they have designed and described the mechanism structure. As for the process of designing the mechanism to realize the kinematic behavior they want, however, the process is still up to the designer's intuition and little computerized aid has been developed. This paper proposes a computerized method of mechanism concept retrieval by behavioral specification. Behavioral characteristics of mechanism concepts are described as configuration spaces and stored in a mechanism concept database. The kinematic behavior a designer wants to realize is described as a locus pattern in a motion parameter space. Then available mechanism concepts to realize the behavior can be retrieved based on pattern matching between the configuration spaces and the locus pattern. The method is implemented as an experimental computer program and applied to simple mechanism design problems as examples. Â© 1994, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Shape from texture is best analysed in a two-stage framework analogous to stereopsis and structure from motion: (a) computing the 'texture distortion' from the image; and (b) interpreting the 'texture distortion' to infer the orientation and shape of the scene surface in 3D. We model the texture distortion at a point in any particular direction on the image plane as an affine transformation and derive the relationship between the parameters of the affine transformation and the surface shape and orientation. We have developed a technique for estimating affine transforms between nearby image patches which is based on solving a system of linear constraints derived from a differential analysis. It is not necessary explicitly to identify texels or make restrictive assumptions about the nature of the image texture like isotropy. We have developed two different models for recovering surface orientation (slant and tilt) and shape (principal curvatures and directions) based on the estimated affine transforms in a number of directions. Experimental results are presented on images of planar and curved surfaces under perspective projection.

AB  - Better automation is a key to the improvement of industrial competitiveness. However, in most industrial plants, full automation is not possible because intelligent decisions play an essential part in guaranteeing the success of the production process. The currently favoured solution is to rely on human controllers for intelligent input, although instances of installations with Al-based control do exist. Our belief is that process control problems require the co-operative application of more than one AI technique to be successful, and that the lack of a common framework to support AI-based process control designs has contributed to their relative lack of penetration in the industrial market-place. The HINT Project (ESPRIT E6447) has been created to address this perceived need. We are engaged in developing a conceptual framework, a software architecture, and a methodology which will together support the integration of different AI techniques to provide solutions to process control problems that require the kind of intelligent supervision that is currently carried out by human operatives.

AB  - Iliad is a large medical diagnostic system that covers more than 2000 diagnoses and 9000 findings. Due to the size and the complexity of this system, a robust knowledge representation is essential to consistently and efficiently model the medical knowledge involved. In this paper, we describe the knowledge representation currently used in Iliad and a probabilistic representation based on the Bayesian network formalism which can be derived using the information that the Iliad knowledge base contains.

AB  - If intelligent vehicle-highway system (IVHS) and traffic management systems are to be successful in the future, a good relationship must exist between the public and private sectors. To foster this relationship in the Houston area, a public-private sector partnership was organized by the Texas Department of Transportation. The initial objective of this group was to improve the sources and use of real-time travel information. This partnership consisted of public-sector transportation agencies, commercial transportation companies, and traffic service organizations. The initial project of the partnership was the development and operation of a cellular phone probe project as a source of real-time travel information. This information was then used by commercial transportation companies and traffic service organizations. This project demonstrated how the public, public agencies, and the private sector can have effective roles in improving the sources and use of travel information.

AB  - Past (rends in reference instruction, query analysis and proliferation of reference tools classed by primary functions into a general typology anticipated the use of paradigm logic, templates, search strategies, and systematic searching in applied Artificial Intelligence research and design of expen system, especially referral and decision-support systems. The approach, methodologies, and technique employed in basic reference and subject-area reference instruction in four graduate library schools, developed first at the University of Maryland after 1976, are reviewed. The advantages and limitations of the latter are discussed to suggest the interplay of personal service, manual tools, and computerized systems for holistic reference programs. Librariansâ transition to the automated tools using AI methods might be improved by introducing paradigms, typologies, strategies, and a systems approach in reference instruction for professionals and more generally in bibliographic instruction.

These approaches often assume a predictability of inquiries, and a continuity and homogeneity of a clientele; or they advocate a reactive service to questions asked, rather than to interact with patrons to form inquiries they may not know how to ask, or in generating new uses.

AB  - The application of high-resolution31Phosphorus Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (31P NMR) Spectroscopy in biology and medicine has provided new insights into biochemical processes and also a unique assessment of metabolites. However, accurate quantification of biological NMR spectra is frequently complicated by: (a) non-Lorentzian form of peak lineshapes, (b) contamination of peak signals by neighboring peaks, (c) presence of broad resonances, (d) low signal-to-noise ratios, and (e) poorly defined sloping baselines. Our objectives were to develop an expert system that captures and formalizes31P NMR spectroscopists' expert knowledge, and to provide a reliable, efficient, and automated system for the interpretation of biological spectra. The NMR Expert System (NMRES) was written in the C and OPS5 programming languages and implemented on a Unix-based (Ultrix) mainframe system with XWindows bitmap graphics display. Expert knowledge was acquired from NMR spectroscopists and represented as production rules in the knowledge base. A heuristic weights method was employed to determine the confidence levels of potential peaks. Statistical and numerical methods were used to facilitate processing decisions. NMR spectra obtained from studies of ischemic neonatal and immature hearts were used to assess the performance of the expert system. The expert system performed signal extraction, noise treatment, resonance assignment, intracellular pH determination, and metabolite intensity quantitation in about 10 s per 4 KB (kilobyte) spectrum. The peak identification success rate was 98.2%. Peak areas and pH estimated by the expert system compared favorably with those determined by human experts. We conclude that the expert system has provided a framework for reliable and efficient quantification of complex biological31P NMR spectra. Â© 1993 Pergamon Press Ltd.

AB  - The Construction Robotic Equipment Management System (CREMS) prototype presented in this paper has been applied to the evaluation of performance of ten diverse construction robots. individual task characteristics along with the robot physical parameters have been analyzed in arriving at appropriate effectiveness and productivity parameters. The wall inspection, clean room inspection and concrete placement tasks were analyzed using a uniform analysis procedure. The number of erected units has been the primary focus of beam and column erection evaluation. Consistency and relative density were considered as parameters associated with productivity of a robotic excavation control system. Underground utilities encountered during excavation imposed limits on the speed of progress and interruptions along the delivery path of concrete distribution. These are regarded as major project-specific constraints for these tasks. An example application of CREMS to robotic excavation has been provided. Â© 1993.

AB  - In construction companies it is common practice that no formal insight exists in the experience acquired by building a project. As a result of this 'practice' wheels are re-invented. In general it is however assumed that experience is of great economic importance especially to these kind of firms. In this article a theory is described of knowledge management. A new profession is introduced: the knowledge manager. The central part of this theory consists of an inventory making method for representing experience. It produces a 'road map' to guide the discussions on 'who learned what' and 'to whom must the experience be transferred'. Employees as the most 'cognitive actors' in problem-solving can be traced. The management can decide on whether to emphasise the concentration of knowledge by these persons or to emphasise the transfer of their knowledge to others. The use and meaning of electronic databases and applications of artificial-intelligence techniques for each of the approaches are completely different. Â© 1993.

AB  - We introduce an interactive computer environment for teaching in general surgery and for diagnostic assistance. The environment consists of a knowledge-based system coupled with an intelligent interface that allows users to acquire conceptual knowledge and clinical reasoning techniques. Knowledge is represented internally within a probabilistic framework and externally through a interface inspired by Concept Graphics. Given a set of symptoms, the internal knowledge framework computes the most probable set of diseases as well as best alternatives. The interface displays CGs illustrating the results and prompting essential facts of a medical situation or a process. The system is then ready to receive additional information or to suggest further investigation. Based on the new information, the system will narrow the solutions with increased belief coefficients.

AB  - Physicians rely on the medical literature as a major source of medical knowledge and data. The medical literature, however, is continually evolving and represents different sources at different levels of coverage and detail. The recent development of computerized medical knowledge bases has added a new form of information that can potentially be used to address the practicing physician's information needs. To understand how the information from various sources differs, we compared the description of a disease found in the QMR knowledge base to those found in two general internal medicine textbooks and two specialized nephrology textbooks. The study shows both differences in coverage and differences in the level of detail. Textbooks contain information about pathophysiology and therapy that is not present in the diagnostic knowledge base. The knowledge base contains a more detailed description of the associated findings, more quantitative information, and a greater number of references to peer-reviewed medical articles. The study demonstrates that computerized knowledge bases, if properly constructed, may be able to provide clinicians with a useful new source of medical knowledge that is complementary to existing sources.

AB  - Structural damage assessment is a process that involves decision-making under uncertainty. Reasoning with or about uncertainty has been the focus of research in many fields in addition to civil engineering, such as decision analysis, philosophy, statistics and psychology. Several methods for the representation of reasoning under uncertainty have been developed. These methods, which the artificial intelligence community refers to as uncertain inference schemes, will be briefly discussed in this paper. One particular scheme, the causal network approach, will be examined in detail. Its application to post-earthquake damage assessment will be given. This particular application represents an approach that has not been used in the structural engineering field before. Â© 1992.

AB  - Knowledgeâbased modeling and simulation bridges the gap between âconventionalâ artificial intelligence implementations (such as expert systems) and more traditional computerâaided design techniques. We are currently developing software, whose primary function is to capture a userâinput design specification and produce a âvirtualâ rapid prototype in the form of executable ruleâbased code. This code can then be exercised either as an interactive part of a hardwareâinâtheâloop testbed simulator or as a component of an objectâoriented âbehavioralâ simulation environment. While the Phalanx Testbed is the immediate beneficiary of this work, the techniques described have a wide range of application in the modeling of conceptual design and performance characteristics. This paper describes the system architecture and software tools that we are applying to generate virtual rapid prototypes for use in the Phalanx Testbed. Particular attention is paid to defining the intelligent knowledgeâcapture mechanisms and model generation methodologies that we are using to translate design knowledge and performance requirements into ruleâbased simulations. The objectâoriented programming approach to the merging of ânewâ data with previouslyâcaptured and stored data is discussed, and the issues of verifying and validating prototypes generated using such partially âreengineeredâ models are examined. An application currently in use as an investigative prototype for testbed development, a simple position controller servomechanism used to control the azimuth angle of a targetâtracking sensor, is used to illustrate the process.

AB  - Numerous history-taking systems have been built to automate the medical history-taking process. These systems differ in their control methods, input and output modalities, and kinds of questions asked. Thus, there has emerged no standard way of representing interviewing knowledge--the expert knowledge used to govern the sequence of questions asked in an interview. This paper discusses how we use an augmented transition network (ATN) to represent the knowledge of a speech-driven automated history-taking program, Q-MED, and how, more generally, ATNs could be used as a representation for any knowledge-based history-taking system. We identify three characteristics of ATNs that facilitate the use of ATNs in interviewing systems: explicitness, hierarchical structure, and generality.

AB  - LiverSoar is a flexible knowledge-based system that can learn from its problem-solving experience in individual cases. Within an opportunistic abductive framework, it can diagnose liver diseases from findings in liver tissue biopsies. As more cases are encountered and more recognition knowledge is acquired, the system becomes prepared for most of the usual cases, hence solves them with less problem-solving effort. At the same time, it stays flexible enough to fall back to deliberative problem solving in more unusual cases if the acquired knowledge does not apply.

AB  - The system architecture and functional operation are described in a centralized state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) expert system for utility application. Experience gained has proven to be invaluable in refining the expert system knowledge bases and has led to other developments which have expanded the coverage of the system. The increased ability of on-line customers to implement predictive maintenance planning has proven to be a cost-saving tool for scheduled maintenance outages. In addition, this paper addresses the elements involved in the installation and operation of the generator AI diagnostic (GenAID) system from the customer's vantage point, such as its economic justification, required system installation activities, and training and operating procedure changes needed to integrate the GenAID system into the existing plant operations.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the application of advanced software techniques for production scheduling and control in CIM systems. The paper describes work in ESPRIT Project 384, 'Integrated Information Processing for the Design, Planning and Control of Assembly'. This project, recently completed, built a fully integrated demonstration prototype of a CIM system covering all aspects of assembly, from product design through to manufacture. The majority of the paper concentrates on the information processing aspects of the CIM subsystem that schedules and controls a workshop dedicated to the automatic assembly of products built in small batches. In particular, it describes how plans, represented in KEE be procedural nets, are matched with Petri nets describing the factory, to produce a schedule. It goes on to explain how KEE, an Artificial Intelligence toolkit, was used to control the scheduled resources in real time. Â© 1991.

AB  - We prospectively identified a cohort of 19 hospital inpatients to serve as a test set to determine the agreement between a physician and a physician's assistant in selecting and entering Quick Medical Reference (QMR) vocabulary terms for use in QMR case analysis mode. For positive findings, there was good agreement between data entered by the physician's assistant and data entered by the physician. Overall matches for positive findings were 0.66 concordance for the initial state, and 0.67 for the final state. Concordance for negative findings was substantially lower. The QMR generated differential diagnoses lists of the physician and physician's assistant were judged as similar in 14 (74%) of the 19 cases when QMR critique and assert functions were used.

AB  - Diagnostic decision support systems are often developed without a clear idea of how well the system will meet the needs of its users. The present study was designed to assess the information needs of clinicians. A set of questions submitted to an information service by family physicians was used to determine how much need there was for diagnostic decision support, the types of support needed, and the general content areas of their questions. Results showed that less than half of the questions were related to diagnosis and that most of those were requests for general information about a given condition. In addition, the fewest diagnosis questions were for conditions that were seen frequently in ambulatory care in a survey of family practitioners.

AB  - Recent installations of distribution automation technology has made it possible to monitor a number of locations in the distribution system on a continuous long-term basis. Unfortunately, due to the resulting volume of distribution automation data, it is difficult and time-consuming for humans to analyze this data effectively. This paper describes automated strategies for the analysis of this data that will lead to more effective uses of this information for improving upon operating, planning, and design practices. To do this, a new approach for automating the management of distribution data was designed and a prototype was implemented. The resulting program, referred to as TAME, uses a combination of procedural and knowledge-based programming techniques to sift through the real-time data with the purpose of identifying patterns or trends which characterize the performance of the distribution system. Examples pertaining to volt/var control and alarm processing are employed to illustrate the benefits of automated data processing and analysis. Â© 1991 IEEE

AB  - Digital signal processors (DSPs) are suitable for a wide variety of computationally intensive real-time applications. This paper describes the architectural features of DSPs for intelligence and control applications, and the node configuration of the IX-n general-purpose neurocomputer, based on the commercially available DSP. DSPs provide high computing power by employing a high level of on-chip parallelism, integrated hardware multipliers, carefully tailored instruction sets, memory organization schemes, hardware support for loop execution, and specific sophisticated addressing modes. High-precision control and fault-tolerance are achieved by exploiting the high-speed arithmetic, on-chip peripherals, direct memory access (DMA) controllers, multiprocessor support and bit-manipulation capabilities of DSPs. Fast multiply/accumulate time, integrated on-chip random access memory (RAM), large address space, high precision and multiprocessor support are necessary for efficient virtual implementation of neural networks.

AB  - The Operations Advisor and the Management Advisor are AI-based executive decision support systems. The Operations Advisor (OA) enables managers to improve manufacturing strategy. It makes possible manufacturing policies that take full advantage of strategic interactions among capacity utilization, inventories, lead times, and unit costs. The Management Advisor (MA) values strategic business proposals (building a new plant, developing a new product, etc.). It helps managers assess the attractiveness of new business opportunities, and the impact of proposed changes in existing business policy. Artificial intelligence methodologies in the MA and the OA allow us to combine conventional analytic techniques with expert knowledge and experience. They also provide an extremely high level or user facilitation, control, and freedom from error, thus substantially improving overall business productivity. We begin with a description of the design strategy underlying these two generic AI-based management applications. Then we consider how this strategy is realized in the OA and the MA, and the productivity benefits it provides to users. Â© 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The pace at which smart structures are moving out of the lab into development is breathtaking. The Air Force, Navy, NASA, and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency have all begun to underwrite research in the field, and the Air Force has made smart structures a top research priority. Most major aircraft makers and defense contractors have a least some research under way, and a few are preparing full-scale tests of a few smart parts. Economic and performance breakthroughs in the development of smart structures are possible at four levels-namely, on-line monitoring, nondestructive evaluation, vehicle health monitoring, and flight control. The current state of smart part art, though, is still years away from some of the more sophisticated uses envisioned by theorists. But there is already surprising consensus about the materials that will be used to add brains to existing advanced composites. Fiber optic glass is the material of choice for sensors. There is less consensus on which actuators to use. Most researchers would prefer to use nonmechanical actuators - materials that change their shape or physical state without any moving parts. Electrorheological (ER) fluids, for example, can turn from liquid to solid milliseconds after application of a small electrical current. Another nonmechanical actuator is lead zirconate titanate (PZT), a piezoelectric ceramic material capable of translating electrical current into the kind of high-speed oscillation used for high-frequency tweeters on stereo speakers. Shape memory alloys (SMAs), metals that can be 'trained' to change their shape as temperatures rise, are the third type of nonmechanical actuator attracting notice.

AB  - Automated assistance of system control-related decision making in complex real time environments poses important design and analysis problems and draws attention to fundamental issues in systems science. These issues are elementary but theoretically very rich. However, they are not well integrated in the literature for the purposes of decision support system engineering and are often very technically specialized. This paper outlines some of those problems and issues in the context of real time decision support systems and in so doing attempts to be fundamental and yet informal.

AB  - This report describes how an arbitrator for the game of Diplomacy was implemented in PROLOG, and discusses the advantages of logic programming for this type of problem. The design of the program is greatly simplified by using a default reasoning style to express many of the game rules. The technique of default reasoning is to specify a predicate (or property or situation) by stating sufficient conditions for a general rule, and then stating exceptions to it. Logic programming supports the expression of default reasoning quite directly with negation as failure. Tight derivations were employed to analyze cycles correctly. A tight derivation is one in which no goal has an identical ancestor. Speaking informally, any provable goal is provable by a tight derivation, so restricting the proof searches to tight derivations does not lose any proofs. Only the parts of the program that are susceptible to infinite recursions check for tightness. It is known that the use of tight derivations corresponds to a certain "preferred", or "canonical", minimal model for many programs that contain negation as failure; in such programs, there is normally no minimum model. Care must be taken in the way defaults are expressed to achieve proper correspondence between the model and the game rules. Â© 1990.

AB  - In this paper we present an Expert System for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Preeclampsia (ESPRE), a ruled-based medical expert system that supports diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in the realm of this disease and that is being used for training physicians. ESPRE applies pragmatic criteria for classifying, diagnosing, and treating preeclampsia. This system can guide the user to collect patient information easily, and based on those items of information that leads to the possible diagnose and treatment of preeclampsia. ESPRE has been deployed at Hospital Universitario de Los Andes, a large tertiary-care teaching hospital in MÃ©rida, Venezuela, since June 1998. We describe the expert system design, and a predeployment performance evaluation. The features of ESPRE are presented, and the possibilities and limitations of its use as well as that of expert systems in general are discussed. Systems such as ESPRE require careful evaluation and, if proven effective and accurate, present to practitioners a new tool for delivering high-quality and individually adapted health care.

AB  - Over the past three decades, Malaysia has shown impressive economic growth, placing this country in a group of fast-growing Southeast Asian economies and among the top performing economies in the world. This achievement has been consciously undertaken through export expansion strategies and by attracting foreign investments. Using an artificial intelligence approach and data from 1966 to 1994, the purpose of this study is to investigate the role of exports in the economic growth and development of Malaysia. The results of this new methodology confirm the earlier findings that exports strongly contributed to the economic growth and development of Malaysia. The results of the model simulation for the in-sample and out-of-sample data show that the model's forecast is better than that of the regression approach.

AB  - The introduction of technology into library information systems has provided new and enhanced search powers in the following areas: the speed of searching large individual and federated databases, keyword access, access to value-added metadata, customized interfaces (that relieve the burden of difficult techniques for sophisticated options), combinatories for citation and semantic analysis, post-search relevancy analysis, release from the cost recovery scenario, and smart agent assistance. These advances save time, provide new research possibilities, and create new data relationships and research areas. However, there are still many areas in which improvements are needed: filters for handling information overload, cross-database searching standards, subject schema normalization, and balancing the need for subject-specific customization and cross-disciplinary standardization. Regardless of the technological advances, there will always be a need for critical thinking skills in order to perform an adequate research search.

AB  - In this work, failure event is categorized into three classes: an anomaly; an impending failure; or an active failure. Using the definitions of these three failure classes, a reasoner architecture is developed whose integrated solution set provides a framework for next generation vehicle-health-maintenance systems. Further, it is shown that it is theoretically possible to use this reasoner architecture to reduce the physical redundancy in the vehicle design while maintaining safety, thus reducing cost, weight, and power.

AB  - In this paper, we describe how rover command generation can be automated to increase robustness and help relieve some of the burden on human operators. We describe the issues inherent in the operations planning for a distributed set of rovers, and how they can be addressed using a centralized framework that is a generalization of single rover paradigm. Finally, we describe a prototype system for automatically generating low-level commands to achieve high-level goals for a set of rovers simulated on a terrain of geological interest.

AB  - The paper delineates the scope and potential of intelligent learning techniques in the design and development of information fusion processors for deployment in multi-source environments. First, the need for non-traditional distance metric concepts capable of handling broad spectrum of feature information sources that may be input to a features in-decision out (FEI-DEO) type of fusion process is brought out. The potential of recently reported advances in the artificial intelligence community in meeting these requirements is discussed. This is followed by a discussion of the role of intelligent fusion learning techniques in the context of decisions in-decision out (DEI-DEO) type of fusion processes. This includes a brief presentation of a newly defined measure of performance of such DEI-DEO fusion processes. The role of intelligent learning techniques in facilitating the development of self-improving fusion systems, is addressed next. Finally, the learning in the context of features in-features out (FEI-FEO), data in-data out (DAI-DAO) and data in-features out (DAI-FEO) modes of fusion are discussed briefly to cover the spectrum of possible fusion modes.

AB  - There has been a growing interest in the use of cognitive task analysis (CTA) to understand the requirements of cognitive work and provide a foundation for design of new training and decision support systems. While CTA techniques have proved successful in illuminating the sources of cognitive complexity in the environment and the basis of human expertise, there remains a wide diversity in techniques employed, information generated, and representational formalisms.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify leprosy patients' psychosocial problems experienced after they were informed about their diagnosis. We focused attention upon concerns and behavioral changes related to their families, friends, jobs and to themselves. Data were obtained by a two opened questions interview and they were analysed with the aid of artificial intelligence techniques. These intelligence tools were used to discover the most frequent words, phrases and concepts existing in the interview reports. The results showed that after being informed about their diagnosis, the majority of the patients referred some concerns and behavioral changes related to their families, friends, jobs and to themselves. The main concerns of the population were related to the disease (transmission, the treatment extension, the possibility of hospitalization, the uncertainty about the cure). These facts induced some of the patients to avoid telling people about the disease they have.

AB  - A concept is presented for facilitating planning, communication, and the use of standardized tools during the design process. This is accomplished through a browser like Concurrent Engineering Project Management (CEPM) overlay on each designer's work-station. The CEPM allows designers to navigate through active projects and invokes available design tools and communication networks. The unique contribution of the concept is an object oriented Product Development Protocol (PDP) for each project which pre-defines the specific tasks, deliverables, tools, and communication links. The paper describes the foundation concepts which underpin the CEPM and relate the PDP to structural models of the design culture. The research reported here was funded by NSF (DMI-9414273) and McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Corporation and is part of an international research consortium developing Intelligent Manufacturing Systems.

AB  - Contemporary computer technology allows robotic cells to communicate and cooperate. However, this expanded functionality requires more intelligence and better management of the cooperating robots. This paper presents a software methodology to accommodate real time constraints imposed by cooperating robots, or any other task related constraint. This methodology is general and is capable of handling a large variety of exceptions such as task failures, sensor interruptions, and equipment failures. The methodology presented treats exceptions as tasks with special features; hence, the methodology expands into task management in a general robotic cell. The methodology can accommodate failures independent of any hardware. In addition to the obvious functional benefits, this approach also allows easier development of robotic tasks, and improved portability of tasks among systems. The methodology is demonstrated using an example with two cooperating robots. Â© 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Permeability is a key parameter associated with the characterization of any hydrocarbon reservoir. Till now, the Petroleum Industry tries to acquire reliable permeability values via laboratory coring measurements, or well test interpretation, which are both accurate, but not adequate methods for complete reservoir description. The wire-line log data and core plug analysis correlation have also been used to estimate permeability; but, due to the methods available, this approach fails to satisfy the need for accurate and adequate results. Actually, only one of those methods, the method using artificial neural networks (ANNs) do promise some future; but, this method also has its own disadvantages like failing to succeed when limited core plug analysis data is available. A new approach favouring the use of neighbour log data point relations to predict reliable permeability values from wire-line logs with only limited core plug analysis data, is proposed as a solution. The paper - also - consists of a review of conventional ANN architecture; and, tries to reveal some inter-relations of ANN design parameters. A case study is included to present the conventional and proposed designs of back-propagated ANNs as tools to predict permeability where only limited and heterogeneous core data is available.

AB  - Investigating user interface design and development problems is the core of current HCI research. Concepts such as intelligent user interfaces, adaptive user interfaces, user interface management systems (UIMSs), and multimedia user interfaces have gained the greatest momentum. Each of these concepts studies a major characteristics of the user interface systems' design. Intelligent user interfaces apply available knowledge about the task to the control of the interaction, in order to increase efficiency and usability. Adaptive user interfaces utilise the knowledge about the user to configure the interface for different users, i.e. each user may have different skills, level of experience, or cognitive and physical abilities. The UIMS corner-stone is to separate the user interface from the application, in order to facilitate the design and development. Applying multimedia concepts to user interface systems can provide enriched, efficient, and flexible interaction. Particular attention has been paid to users with special needs. The "Design for all" concept is a principle recently acknowledged in the HCI field. The conclusions underline the improvement that such a design approach can offer to users with special needs, from educational and vocational points of view.

AB  - The paper provides a scheme for the autonomous acquisition of a consistent relational structure of knowledge representation in artificial intelligent systems. The hypothesis abducted from recent experimental evidence proposes that the cortex developed top-down under the control of a value system,and that a minimal set of genetically encoded coarse but holistic a-priori knowledge guides the selforganization of knowledge representation.

AB  - This paper gives an overview of a major integrated oil company's experience with expert systems over the last five years. First artificial intelligence, AI, and expert systems are defined. Then the development of an artificial intelligence group is chronicled, including details on development tool selection, project selection strategies, and potential pitfalls. Three potential pitfalls in the areas of technology, marketing and social behavior that the knowledge engineer should be aware of when developing a new AI application are identified. Next other artificial intelligence technologies are summarized. Finally eight completed expert systems are described. Copyright 1993, Society of Petroleum Engineers Inc.

AB  - A primary objective of technical education should be the development of thinkable models in the minds of students. Thinkable models are representations of things and processes simple enough that people can use them in thought experiments. The organization of cognitive structures for technical domains can be imagined to be a network of appropriately connected thinkable models. Artificial intelligence (AI), as the science of representations, has focused in the main on languagelike representations. If we can enrich our vision of representations to include a greater variety of ways of thinking that are useful to people, we may hope to broaden access to scientific ideas. To pursue these notions in some detail, a taxonomy of models is developed and the issue of how representations relate to human modes of perception and action is raised. The notions are explored first through contrasting of several approaches to the Pythagorean Theorem.

N1  - Funding textÂ 1:Â This article is an extract from the longer article âShared Models: The Cognitive Equivalent of a Lingua Francaâ (Ar@cial Inrelligence and Sociay, January 1989, now republished as Chapter I Lawler & Yazdani, 1992). Many colleagues have contributed substantially to its development, both through critical and constructive conversations. Most recently and importantly, H. Bauersfeld and G. Albers discussed some of the notions presented here. Different modes of mind, as a psychological issue, was raised by S. White: Cellerierâs early musings on the possibilities of various computational primitives for the different modes marked a convergence I considered important. In the background of this work, never very far, are notions absorbed from years of interactions with R.B. Davis, W. Feurzeig, M. Minsky, S. Papert, O.G. Selfridge, and M. Yazdani. G. Lawler has been a valued critic and the long-suffering victim of too many early drafts. An equipment grant from the Apple Education Foundation, a research grant from the National Research Council, and the continuing encouragement of my research liason at the Army Research Institute, J. Psotka, has permitted this work to go forward.

AB  - The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in telecommunication has evolved over the past 10 years. A decade ago, AI approaches applied in telecommunication were primarily rule-based. Typical systems have been developed which monitor the performance of networks continuously and search the resulting time varying diagnostic data using machine learning and correlation techniques, and generate a set of rules to predict potential failures before they occur. Hill climbing techniques for tuning parameters in the knowledge base of an existing diagnostic rule-based system, have also been developed.

AB  - It is difficult to attempt to structure the benefits and hazards of rapidly evolving technologies within an envelope that defines what is safe, feasible, and economically viable. Experts may not have a neat solution, but they can sometimes use experience and wisdom to strike a spark that illuminates the issue. Toward this end, four authorities in human performance and automation debated at the 39th Annual Meeting of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, held in San Diego in 1995. This report is a condense version of the lively debate that ensued.

AB  - This paper describes a computer program for disambiguating the meaning of verbal acts in social interaction. The program was implemented using artificial intelligence techniques, representing utterances by frames, designing separate agents employing procedural rules to infer values of each coding dimension, and sharing information through a blackboard. The computer algorithms are discussed and illustrated with examples, then results of an empirical test of the program are reported. A training-set of verbal interactions among health care practitioners and patients was examined to build the program, with an independent test-set of data used to assess program performance. On a practical level, this program offers a promising approach for computer-assisted or even automatic coding of interaction processes, reducing coding costs and improving reliability and validity. On a theoretical level, these algorithms offer a model of how individuals disambiguate the meaning of verbal comments in social interaction, providing substantive insights into the mechanisms of social interaction.

AB  - The information-based society, supported by information technology and advanced communications infrastructure, will inevitably lead to flexible organisations and new ways of working. An example of this is the rise in the prominence of teleworking. This article presents several drivers and enablers of teleworking practice. Communication and information technology trends have been described, along with the requirements of future organisations and the benefits of flexible working for the organisation and the individual. Teleworking represents a major opportunity for businesses to achieve flexibility and responsiveness and to reduce costs.

AB  - The optimal operational integrity of a health care facility depends upon the correct interpretation of an adherence to well designed and written policies. Memos describing policy and procedures can be ambiguous, hindering their comprehension rather than helping it. Two alternative methods have been developed for communicating policy: the algorithmic flow chart and a computer decision support program. To determine the best means of communicating policy, the written memo, flow chart, and computer program were compared in scenario presentation interviews. The average time required to complete the test scenarios was five minutes for the traditional memo, two minutes for the algorithm, and two minutes for the computer program. Accuracy improves markedly from the traditional memo to the computer program. ANOVA reveals that the flow chart and computer program are significantly superior to memos as methods for communicating hospital policy.

The models are first explained in some detail and then evaluated on the same population of trauma patients. The goal of both systems is to predict the outcome of those patients. The results are summarized and explained in terms of differing algorithms of the two models.

AB  - Long-term maintenance operations, causing the unit to out of action, may seem economical - but they result in reduced operating readiness. Offsetting that concern, careless, hurried maintenance reduces margins of safety and reliability. Any tool that improves maintenance without causing a sharp increase in cost is valuable. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the tools. Expert system and neural networks are two different areas of AI that show promise for turboprop engine maintenance.

AB  - While consciousness has not been a major concern of most AI researchers, some theorists have tried to explore how computational models might explain consciousness. I explore how far computational models might go in explaining consciousness, focusing on three aspects of conscious mental states: their instrinsic intentionality, the awareness a subject has of the contents of these intentional states, and the distinctive qualitative character of these states. I describe and evaluate strategies for developing connectionist systems that satisfy these aspects of consciousness. Â© 1995.

AB  - In many practical cases, it is very difficult to build expert systhesis which have a sufficient degree of flexibility with respect to the relevant probability judgements. It is in general maintained that assessments of probabilities require an overall design on the whole set of all possible envisaged situations, and hence that they cannot be easily achieved. A problem that often occurs in artificial intelligence is the following: the field expert is actually able to give reliable numerical evaluations of the degree of belief concerning only a few uncertain situations, i.e. the ones strictly related to the problem at hand and known by the field expert. The aim of this paper is to exhibit the usefulness of the probabilistic approach based on de Finetti's theory of coherence to deal with this kind of uncertain and vague information.

AB  - An unsupervised neural network was developed to fuse multisensory information for a multilink robotic arm/hand system for target detection. The network is a hybrid network that combines the following: a) a modified backpropagation learning rule in a self-organizing fashion, for extracting the features, and b) the Kohonen linear vector quantization (LVQ) method to classify the objects based on the extracted features. The overall hybrid network is totally unsupervised because it does not need the intervention of a human operator to provide the desired outputs during learning.

AB  - The paper investigates conditional tabled eco-grammar systems with terminal symbols, proving results about their generative capacity. A particular class of such eco-grammar systems is proved to be equivalent to matrix grammars with appearance checking. In the general, as well as in the restricted case considered, it is proved that the number of agents does not influence the power of the system.

AB  - Technologies emerging in the fields of telecommunications, video and digital imaging, and microprocessing are shaping the future of nursing practice. To measure up to the future needs of nursing, nurses of today must have the vision and desire to become computer aware and technologically literate. Hypothetical future situations pose challenges related to current nursing informatics and artificial intelligence issues. Discussion includes technology issues related to the lifetime clinical health record. Areas that the Center for Nursing Research considers priorities for informatics suggest directions for nursing technology efforts. This article calls on all nurses to become active in designing and molding future clinical practice systems. Copyright Â© 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Tokyo steel's flagship Okayama minimill is utilizing a DC furnace manned by 120 employees to produce 1.2 million metric tons of hot-rolled coil annually. Productivity on the DC-furnace line translates into 10,000 annual metric tons per worker. The DC furnace uses one electrode that is 30 in. in diameter and 110 in. in length. The electric furnace and the ladle furnace on the other hand, are operated by a crew of only three employees, who use computer control. Like all Tokyo steel, the entire Okayama mill is highly computerized. Every phase of mill operation from melting to rolling and from production scheduling to business reporting is controlled by the company's AI Expert System.

AB  - Explicit temporal representation and reasoning (TRR) in medical decision-support systems (MDSS) is generally considered to be a useful but often neglected aspect of system design and implementation. Given the great burden of explicit TRR both in knowledge acquisition and computational efficiency, developers of general-purpose large-scale systems typically utilize implicit (i.e., abstracted) forms of TRR. We are interested in understanding better the trade-offs of not incorporating explicit TRR in large general-purpose MDSS along the dimensions of system expressive power and diagnostic accuracy. In particular, we examine the types of abstracted TRR employed in QMR, a diagnostic system in the domain of general internal medicine, and the high-level effects of such an implicit treatment of time in the system's diagnostic performance. We present our findings and discuss implications for MDSS design and implementation practices.

AB  - Recently the issue of knowledge acquisition through knowledge modeling has drawn much attention from AI researchers and practitioners. In this paper we point out that knowledge modeling can be incorporated by traditional decision-making, and investigate how to achieve this. We describe an approach of knowledge modeling that employs the notion of a knowledge chart to capture the whole picture of experts' knowledge of decision-making for domain-specific problem-solving. A case study for television (TV) trouble-shooting is used as an example to illustrate the general idea.

AB  - This article looks at what the natural evolution of robots can do for the clinical testing industry, from performing simple functions to becoming the prime labor force of the clinical laboratory. Until now, robots have been applied to instrument processes as somewhat of an upgrade to accomplish a variety of laboratory tasks. Over the next 10 years, however, robotics development will respond to the internal and external influences expected to challenge the industry. A limited supply of human workers and the increased demands of testing volumes and cost-effectiveness will herald a new phase of robotics to link, as well as develop, technological capabilities. Since science fiction was invented, robots have teased the imagination-alternately as mindless automatons or as clones of their inventors endowed with minds of their own. The appeal in the first case was the seemingly infinite capacity for performing menial tasks too boring, complex, or dangerous for mankind. The appeal in the second was the fantasy of artificial intelligence. In both cases, the fictional concept has become reality-and, by the 21st century, should even be commonplace. Financial encouragement of robotics development might even be a mission for laboratories themselves, as they prepare for potential competition from even more complex technology.

AB  - In this paper, we describe the evolution of the KDM from its Functional Data Model origins to its active, object-oriented database version called Active KDL (Knowledge/Data Language). One spinoff of KDL, called d-KDL, addresses inference related issues focusing on the specification and handling of defeasible rules. Historically extended KDL, h-KDL, extends KDL by including historical information. We discuss the evolution of the KDM from a model intended to bridge the gap between database and knowledge base systems to our more recent efforts to integrate model bases, databases, and knowledge bases in a unified manner. This includes the evolution of KDL to Active KDL, a comprehensive object-oriented knowledge/data base language designed to support a knowledge/data/ model management environment.

AB  - This paper describes a mobile robot architecture, called the CMU architecture, the goal of which is to enable driving of robot vehicles in a nonuniform outdoor environment. For this goal, the CMU architecture distributes processing modules among multiple computers and executes them in parallel. In order to realize multiple driving modes, the CMU architecture accommodates high-level route navigation in addition to a local control. Then it decomposes the system into several layers which work in parallel and are governed by command-report interactions. Based on the data flow within the layers, the layers are decomposed into several modules which work in parallel. Because of the parallelism both among and within the layers, CMU architecture provides enough computation power for outdoor navigation. The CMU architecture was verified with experimental runs.

AB  - Can new medical knowledge be recognized computationally? We know knowledge is changing, and our knowledge-based systems will need to accommodate that change in knowledge on a regular basis if they are to stay successful. Computational recognition of these changes seems desirable. It is unlikely that low level objects in the computational universe, bits and characters, will change much over time, higher level objects of language, where meaning begins to emerge, may show change. An analysis of ten arbitrarily selected paragraphs from the Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program of the American College of Physicians was used as a test bed for nominal phrase recognition. While there were words not known to Meta-1.2, only 8 of the 32 concepts new to the primary author were pointed to by new words. Use of a barrier word method was successful in identifying 23 of the 32 new concepts. Use of co-occurrence (in sentences) of putative nominal phrases may reduce the amount of human effort involved in recognizing the emergence of new relationships.

AB  - Complex computer networks require considerable configuration at the commissioning stage. This configuration ranges from the infer-connecting links between modules and software to the inputting of information data. The Modern Building Management System (BMS) comprises such computer networks allowing the monitoring and control of what has become known as the Intelligent Building. Such a building incorporates integrated services including environmental controls, fire and security. The traditional method of configuring such systems involves many manhours of system definition and scheduling of the interconnecting software links. Artificial intelligence is concerned with making machines carry out tasks which, were they performed by humans, would be considered to require intelligence. This paper describes the development of an expert system that automatically produces a point file for a BMS, together with all the necessary documentation. Reference is made to the applications of the expertsystem to the installation and commissioning of a BMS in a large airport project.

AB  - People from the development and production industry have often to cope with inspection problems which require vision expertise. It becomes therefore very difficult for them to overcome these problems without external assistance from vision experts. Even if today, image processing libraries are widely distributed, the development of a robust vision system requires to have large experience in the field of industrial vision. This is the reason for proposing now a new environment for vision which aims at leading the user from a real application to a robust vision system. Such an environment includes industrial vision knowledge and acts as an intelligent assistant. It is called the VSDE (Vision Systems Development Environment).

AB  - A real-time expert system that deciphers CO2 waveforms (capnograms) is described. The Capnogram Analyzer Expert System (CAES) was designed using both traditional pattern-recognition methods and an artificial intelligence (AI) approach for signal description and classification. The pattern-recognition technique is used to extract features from the digitized CO2 waveforms. The AI approach involves abstracting CO2 waveforms from numeric representation to higher-level symbolic representation, and a so-called reasoning step to analyze the symbolic data. The CAES consists of three essential components: segmentation, single breath cycle identification, and waveform classification. Each component is an expert in itself and is responsible for abstracting the waveform information from a lower level to a higher level using its own domain-specific knowledge base.

AB  - As we understand the process of ambulatory care better, the need to effectively implement standards of practice becomes more apparent. To facilitate successful use of practice guidelines, we have integrated an artificial intelligence system of Medical Logic Modules into our computerized medical record. A rule shell allows rapid development and prototyping of rules which can be practice reminders, information gathering utilities, or standing orders. A set of utilities allows non-programmer clinicians to develop and maintain the rule set. We will demonstrate these enhancements in the context of the comprehensive patient record.

AB  - Abduction, or inference to a best explanation, is a ubiquitous type of inference that is frequently used by humans in a wide range of tasks. However, many realistic domains have properties that make abduction computationally intractable (i.e., where the time to reach a solution increases exponentially with the number of possible explanations). We present a domain task analysis and performance evaluation of RedSoar, a plausible cognitive computational model of abduction, that accomplishes the antibody identification task in immunohematology. The task analysis reveals how a computationally intractable abductive problem, where one is seeking optimal solutions, can be reformulated to be a computationally tractable abductive problem, by seeking satisfactory rather then optimal solutions. From the satisfactory perspective, our evaluation framework of RedSoar's performance explores the computational benefits and costs of having directly available abstract hypothesis formation knowledge, and how a strong causal constraint between hypotheses and data reduces the combinatorial explosion of constructing a best explanation.

AB  - Sequential probability ratio tests (SPRTs) are applied to the monitoring of nuclear power reactor signals. The theory of SPRTs applied to correlated data that have an unknown distribution is very incomplete. Unfortunately, a common problem regarding the application of sequential methods to reactor variables is that the variables are often contaminated with noise that is either non-Gaussian or serially correlated (or both). A Fourier series approximation can be used to remove much of the correlation in the data. This method is relatively simple to implement but has the desirable property of reducing correlation, thereby allowing the assumption of Gaussian, independent data to hold more readily. Delayed neutron signal data and reactor coolant pump data are analyzed. The theory has been validated by extensive testing with data from the Experimental Breeder Reactor II. The use of SPRT techniques as decision aids in two artificial intelligence-based expert systems for surveillance and diagnosis applications in nuclear reactors is also discussed.

AB  - The question of why some Wall Street AI applications are successful while others fail is explored. The Wall Street problem domain is modeled from a knowledge-based perspective, and the environment is represented from both an object-oriented view and a process view. Both models demonstrate the complexity inherent in formally defining the Wall Street environment. Analytic and cognitive models of the Wall Street environment are discussed, focusing on the shortcomings of each approach. The use of a new type of intelligent tool, called a collaborative system, that combines analytic models, human judgment, and cognitive models is proposed.

AB  - In the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) formulation used in artificial intelligence, the variables related by the constraints may be initially unknown within their domains but are assumed to have some exact value in each solution. This approach leads to representational and computational problems when dealing with incompletely specified, i.e., underconstrained CSPs as the number of solutions explodes combinatorially or becomes infinite with infinite domains. I argue that this problem can be solved by generalizing the CSP formulation into what is called a tolerance constraint satisfaction problem. A new reasoning scheme for solving the tolerance CSP, tolerance propagation (TP), has been designed and implemented. The idea of the tolerance approach is to aim at and reason with solutions and value assignments in which variables refer to sets and intervals, i.e., to tolerances, instead of exact values. This makes it possible to represent and reason with incomplete and partly inconsistent knowledge in a well-defined way. Additional representational and computational power is obtained without losing the possibility of dealing with exact values that can be represented as singleton tolerances. The tolerance CSP cannot be solved by current constraint satisfaction techniques that are based on searching or synthesizing exact value solutions by constraint propagation or can find only locally consistent solutions. It is shown that the tolerance scheme generalizes current numerical exact value propagation systems and provides a rigid foundation for interval labeling systems based on interval arithmetic. Application of the scheme to propositional logics leads into logical tolerance (constraint) systems that can be used to produce more intuitive results than ordinary two-, multiple-, or multivalued logics when dealing with incomplete knowledge.

AB  - The paper describes how the Hybrid Phenomena Theory (HPT) may be applied for identification of the appropriate structure of a state space model of a physical system. The HPT formalizes the relationship between symbolic descriptions of the structure of physical systems and mathematical models of those systems. Knowledge on physical interactions is expressed in descriptions of phenomena. A phenomenon definition contains both conditions for when a phenomenon will occur and the effect this has on a state space model describing the physical system. The HPT establishes explicit connections between each term in the state space model, the conditions justifying this term and ultimately the physical phenomenon giving rise to the term. As the validity of different conditions changes due to changes in operation point of the process, the related phenomena may switch between active and passive causing the structure of the mathematical model to change. This enables us to identify the appropriate structure of the state space model through on-line application of our first principle knowledge on physical process systems. We show that the relations between topology, physical phenomena and the structure of the mathematical model may be formalized by means of the HPT. Â© 1992.

AB  - THE ACTIVITY OF EXPLAINING has been studied and modeled by Artificial Intelligence researchers for almost two decades. While no stand-alone educational applications have resulted, a number of techniques have been developed that, when combined in the right way, can support automated explanation facilities capable of playing a useful role as one educational resource amongst others. In this paper, I will briefly survey the available techniques and evaluate their utility in generating explanations. I then show how these techniques are combined in the design of a computer program that provides explanations in response to questions in physical science domains and discuss the contribution such a facility could make to the computer-based educational environments of the future.

AB  - Diversity of electronic products, lack of human expertise, and inconsistency among manually generated process plans increase the necessity of developing Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) systems for electronic assembly. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a few techniques to develop CAPP systems which would behave in a âknowledgeableâ manner. Two rule-based CAPP systems, a backward-chaining system developed in M. 1 shell and a forward-chaining system developed in OPS 5, and an object-oriented system developed in Objective-C are discussed. The CAPP systems generate processes and select a set of machines to perform the generated processes for a given product. In the rule-based CAPP systems, product characteristics and bill of components are stored in working memory and capabilities of the available machines are stored as rules. In the object-oriented CAPP system, product as well as the available machines are represented as objects. A central decision module which does pattern matching and sends messages to appropriate machines (objects) is developed. Â© 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Corporate networks are growing in popularity and providing more benefits to their users. These networks are based on leading edge, digital communications technology and provide a smooth migration to the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)âthe intelligent, corporate network of the 1990s. As the papers in this issue on intelligent networking will show, AT&T has been and continues to be at the forefront of intelligent, corporate networking with businessâcommunications solutions that provide a rich set of capabilities and an excellent application platform to meet customer needs in the future. To set the framework for the issue, we describe the history of corporate networking and the 1990s' corporateânetwork architecture. We also discuss the role of AT&T's DefinityÂ® communications system in modern, corporateânetwork applications. Â© 1991 AT&T Technical Journal

AB  - This paper presents a knowledge based model for power system steady-state studies. In this model, a power system is represented by three components: power system states, power system operations, and the knowledge base which contains the knowledge about the use of the operations. In the proposed model, the knowledge representation and inference are different from the existing approaches in this area in three aspects. First, the knowledge about power system states and operations is represented by two sets of predicates and frame based structures. This allows efficient data exchange between the model and power flow software. Second, in this model, power system operations are represented by the data structures which are similar to bus and branch data structures used in a power flow program. Third, a special-purpose inference algorithm is developed to manipulate the process of analysis, calculation, and modification of power flow studies. This model is implemented on the IBM 4381 computer and shows high efficiency when used to study a practical power system problem. Â© 1991.

AB  - Expert systems are often less informative than neuromimetic networks with computer simulation of the function of the human brain neurons. These networks predict consumption and detect leaks in a water supply system. The Ile de France regional water authority serves a four million population via 8500 km of piping, and its Water Movement Centre (CME) employs a neuromimetic network. Supply network management by the Saphir expert system optimises operation on the basis of simplified modelling and is used in the control room of the Paris West Water Region. Performance data are given. (R.H.)

It is proved that if phase velocities in the beginning and in the end of control process are non-zero, so the decision is nontrivial. Algorithm of solution of nonlinear problem provides almost time-optimal control. Algorithm efficiency is evaluated by numerical methods.

AB  - Optimization of production flow patterns results from scheduling the working activities to be performed by all Machining Centers (MCs) for processing all required parts. The complexity of this problem is prohibitive for obtaining a practically implementable solution. A decomposition-based approach is therefore highly recommendable. This paper presents a solution based on decomposition of the whole activity scheduling problems into a set of interconnected sub-problems, one for each part family. Since a part family cannot be processed "individually", i.e., on a proper cell, interactions among above mentioned sub-problems exist. The paper proposes a knowledge-based procedure using CAD tools, suitable for managing interactions and aimed at obtaining the best separation of sub-problems. An application of the intelligent CAD tool to a small-scale plant is also presented. Â© 1991 CIRP.

AB  - For better or worse, civilization constantly evolves; it is never static. The creation and use of new knowledge and its notation has passed through many stages in the last 6,000 years from cuneiform tablets to machine readable text. The service of this body of knowledge has similarly matured from that provided in the library at Alexandria to the skilled information specialist of a contemporary research library. This paper proposes a quantum leap forward to a new point at which the information specialist will directly assist the researcher in the creation of new knowledge through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Thus, the reference role is extended from one of seeking bibliographic citations or locating the full-text of articles to one of creatmg new conclusions for a specific problem or thesis.

AB  - Since there are many similarities between the fields of information retrieval and artificial intelligence, it may be appropriate to adapt methods developed in one field to applications usually thought of as belonging to the other. While recent attention in this regard has focused on the use of artificial intelligence methods in the information sciences, this project demonstrates the utility of information retrieval techniques in the expert systems area of artificial intelligence. In particular, it addresses the difficult task of building an expert system for the social sciences. FOCES (FOster Care Expert System) is a prototype assistant to social workers involved in selecting foster homes for children who are in need of placement. The design of FOCES called for use of GUESS (GeneralâpUrpose Expert System Shell) and tailored Prolog routines for extended Boolean matching and vector correlation. Evaluation of the implemented system has shown that FOCES can perform its assigned task as well as trained social workers. Â© 1990 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Copyright Â© 1990 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Starting from the system PRIZ, the method of automatic program synthesis is used in AI systems. We determine (1) the precise description of a class of computational models; (2) the precise description (acute semantics) of such concepts as "a solution of a computational task" and "solvability of a computational task"; (3) the calculus of dependencies OLD, which is proved to be correct and strongly complete with respect to the proposed semantics. On the basis of OLD, we construct an algorithm which analyzes a computational task and synthesizes a program for its solution and which runs in small (subquadratic) space with quasi polynomial time (the degree of the polynomial does not exceed the minimal number of subtasks that must interact in any solution of the main task). This algorithm can synthesize optimal programs which have minimal execution time. Â© 1990.

AB  - In consideration of the present interest in stand-alone nuclear power plants (NPPs) and the potential role of automation of land-based NPPs, a simplified two-level control model for operating a representative plant is assumed. Human factors analysis of three control strategies shows that replacing the senior operator level by a high-level supervisory fuzzy or rule-based controller provides a viable strategy that can free the senior operator for important operational tasks other than vigilance and attendance to details of equipment or subsystems operation. By monitoring plant performance and providing global control actions, the operator can play a more positive role in plant protection and power production.

AB  - In this paper we propose a new method for the creation of subject bibliographies. Our method consists of two phases: first, the raw bibliographical material is downloaded from an online bibliographical database (e.g. DIALOG), and then this material is processed using knowledge-based means. We apply a meta-programming approach in which the raw bibliographic material is viewed as a logic program upon which we develop a second-order logic program. The second-order program creates the subject bibliography by operating a rule base and the first-order logic program. The entire system, named REX, was written in PROLOG and used to create automatically a subject bibliography on Applications of Logic Programming in Decision and Control.

AB  - Automated and computer-based systems for the dynamic management of complex engineering processes have been the subject of active research in recent years. Many of these systems have adopted methodology and technology from the field of artificial intelligence and expert system research. In real-time process diagnosis and process management applications, where model based reasoning may be highly beneficial in terms of speed and functionality, a larger confluence of methods and approaches has started to form. The objective of these applications often includes, besides performing automated fault analysis and diagnosis, also establishing levels of confidence for the results that are obtained. Thus, both deterministic and uncertainty-based models and reasoning frameworks are often needed. Of interest among the deterministic modeling techniques that can be used in a PMS (Process Management System) are binary trees, rule networks, and graph networks, which in turn include influence diagrams, logic flowgraph methodology and signed directed graph. PMS uncertainty management can be based on formal probabilistic methods, such as Bayesian estimation and updating, or less traditional methods such as certainty factors, Dempster-Schafer theory and fuzzy-set theory. The main features, advantages and disadvantages of the approaches and methods that are suitable for use in a PMS are critically examined and discussed. Â© 1990.

AB  - Today's libraries-academic, research, public, and elementary and secondary schools-are in the midst of an extended period of unprecedented change and adjustment. Having never been static organizations, they have existed within and responded to changes in the communities they exist to serve. Computerization, electronics, and telecommunications have resulted in the alteration of almost every function performed in libraries today. The reference services extended by these libraries are no different. In keeping with their missions and goals, they must adopt and incorporate the new information technology now as well as the year 2000 and beyond. Problems and challenges which must be solved and met are discussed. There is no doubt that the library user will benefit as services are expanded to include among other innovations: services expanded beyond the walls of the library and its physical collection, interactive face-to-face teleconferencing with information specialists, and machines utilizing artificial intelligence which assist in identifying and locating information.

AB  - This paper introduces a multi-agent office work system available for mobile environments. We propose an architecture called INA/LI for this multi-agent system. The architecture has three layers, namely, the group work support layer, personal work support layer, and communication support layer. Group work support agents support such tasks as meeting arrangement, resource management and workflow management. Personal work support agents support such tasks as schedule management and mail-filtering. These agents mutually communicate with other agents to execute some of the tasks, e.g., meeting arrangements. Moreover, TPO communication agents provide the same services when we are out of the office as well as in the office. Therefore, we can use these agent services at any time, and at any place. This system can therefore increase office work productivity owing to automated incidental office activities through the collaboration of agents. In addition, developers are able to extend this multi-agent system prior to the INA/LI library.

AB  - This paper presents a brief outline of the Mobidget programming language, which is designed for mobile and distributed computation. An agent, which is an abstraction of a process and a protection domain, can migrate either in whole or in part to different nodes in the network during execution. Objects in an agent may be distributed to several nodes in the network, and even if their exact location is unknown, they can be accessed from the other parts of the agent located on different nodes. Other features, such as inter-agent communication and base-specific method invocation, are also described.

AB  - It is well known that pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics play a key role in understanding of drug effects, in rationalization of drugs dosage form development as well as in effectiveness of general and individual therapy design. In the area compartment modelling supported with computer simulation is very popular also due to the fact that it provides very clear structural picture about the fate of the drug in human or animal body which can be easily correlated to the real situation. However, nowadays some artificial intelligence and control approaches can be introduced to somehow complete compartment models in the sense of modern needs. Such models can be referred to as compartment based hybrid models. In the work some possibilities of control principles, fuzzy and neural models as well as genetic algorithms usage in pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling are discussed and illustrated with examples of concrete studies.

AB  - Emerging artificial intelligence techniques such as genetic algorithms (GAs) allow a more realistic representation and solution of difficult and combinatorial problems such as the dynamic traffic queue management problem. Computational experience in solving such complex large-scale problems by use of micro-GAs is described. In addition to providing evidence of the ability of micro-GAs to successfully identify optimal traffic management schemes, some micro-GA-associated computational issues that warrant attention are highlighted. Choosing a proper population size is a critical decision, and internal variability must be accounted for to assess the goodness of the optimization results properly. A simple rule for deciding the best population size for micro-GAs is proposed. Micro-GAs may converge to low-quality solutions, particularly with very small population sizes; convergence of micro-GAs by itself is not a sufficient indication of good performance. The size of the search space for some real-world systems can pose some difficulties to micro-GAs. Choosing between micro-GAs and regular GAs is a problem-dependent decision.

AB  - This work intends to design, analyze and solve, from the systems control perspective, a complex, dynamic, and multiconstrained planning system for generating training plans for crew members of the NASA-led International Space Station. Various intelligent planning systems have been developed within the framework of artificial intelligence. These planning systems generally lack a rigorous mathematical formalism to allow a reliable and flexible methodology for their design, modeling, and performance analysis in a dynamical, time-critical, and multiconstrained environment. Formulating the planning problem in the domain of discrete-event systems under a unified framework such that it can be modeled, designed, and analyzed as a control system will provide a self-contained theory for such planning systems. This will also provide a means to certify various planning systems for operations in the dynamical and complex environments in space. The work presented here completes the design, development, and analysis of an intricate, large-scale, and representative mathematical formulation for intelligent control of a real planning system for Space Station crew training. This planning system has been tested and used at NASA-Johnson Space Center. Â© 1999 IEEE.

AB  - Manufacturers faced with small production runs often require multiple machine changeovers per shift. Vision control of machinery offers a cost-effective solution to this problem. Manufacturers are able to introduce diverse products, randomly, to a process line during the same production run, using reasonably priced industrial electronic equipment incorporating vision technology. A vision controlled polyurethane dispensing machine has been designed, manufactured and commissioned to substantiate this theory. An image of a moat, recessed into a mould, is captured by means of a CCD camera, resulting in a dispensing path being transferred to a microprocessor. The analogue signal is converted to a digital signal that presets a path for the two-axis motion controller, capable of performing interpolation, to follow. A polyurethane mixing machine receives the same digital signal which sets the dispensing rate and shot size. Polyurethane is dispensed into the moat to form a seal between the filter media and the air-filter housing. A summary of the design, implementation and results of the project is outlined and described. Â© MCB University Press.

AB  - This paper explores an alternative approach to automated test generation based on AI technology: planner based test generation. In planner based test generation, test cases are generated from a domain theory (model of the system being tested), and a description of the initial and desired (goal) state(s) of the system. We identify three key issues and trade-offs in the process of developing a planner based automated test case generator: how to extract knowledge about the domain (domain analysis), how to represent the knowledge (pragmatics of domain representation in the planner) and how to decompose the generation process to exploit the planner's capabilities. We illustrate what we have learned with examples and evaluation of the resulting test cases and the process of generating them.

AB  - Our objective is to provide a collection of automated tools and techniques for reducing operational and maintenance costs in space planes. To demonstrate our capability, we used the AFE of JPL which will be flown on the X-33 as the testbed to examine our techniques. This paper discusses the tools that were used to develop that software. Another paper is in preparation to discuss the artificial intelligence being flown on the AFE. One of the technology demonstrations on the AFE was to show how artificial intelligence could be used for reducing operational and maintenance costs. For this we used two JPL developed tools: Tspec and SHINE. Tspec was used for the automated testing and verification of portions of the AFE's software. SHINE was used as a high-speed inference engine for monitoring, analysis and diagnosis of portions of the AFE hardware. Faults are detected and diagnosed in flight with their resolutions logged by the X-33's. This paper provides an overview of SHINE. A description of Tspec can be found from the references.

AB  - PDP models (sometimes misnamed "connectionist") solve computational problems with a family of algorithms, but changeable weights between their connections mean that the details of their algorithms are subject to change. Thus they do not fulfill the requirement that a model must specify its algorithm for solving a computational problem, or that it must model real data and fail to model false data. Other models use distributed coding but retain homeomorphism and explicit algorithms. An example uses a lateral inhibitory network with fixed weights to model visual masking and sensory memory.

AB  - Green's (1998) target article is an attack on most current connectionist models of cognition. Our commentary will suggest that there is an essential component missing in his discussion of modeling, namely, the idea that the appropriate level of the model needs to be specified. We will further suggest that the precise form (size, topology, learning rules, etc.) of connectionist networks will fall out as ever more detailed constraints are placed on their function.

AB  - Major construction firms involved in multiple projects within one time frame, are usually faced with the challenge of allocating different resource classes among these projects. To retain business profitability, maintaining optimum resource allocation on present and future construction work must be systematically estimated. This paper demonstrates the application of an artificial intelligence search technique entitled Genetic Algorithm (GA), which can provide assistance to construction managers in computing optimum resource levels that have to be maintained by a construction firm involved in multiple construction projects. The paper discusses the concepts, procedures and search capabilities of genetic algorithms. The paper then demonstrates the application of a genetic algorithm in allocating multiple resources, namely multi-labor trades, into multiple construction projects. Deviations of the labor requirement from labor allocation, which are influenced by labor wage rate, overtime rate, priority of the project, and constrained by certain operational constraints such as the maximum amount of labor allowed to work in a project site and maximum amount of labor allowed to be hired for each trade etc., have been formulated as the objective function to be minimized by the genetic algorithm. The paper concludes with a discussion on the lessons learned from this implementation.

AB  - This paper discusses capabilities built into the Seawolf Ship Control System (SCS) to enhance maintainability and how they have proved to be effective during development and initial service. These capabilities include automatic Performance Monitoring and Fault Localization (PM/FL) functions and a maintenance computer containing I/O monitoring functionality to troubleshoot the system. The success of the PM/FL approach demonstrates great promise for future submarines and surface ships, allowing for a reduction in the size of the crew needed to operate and maintain the ship control. But this PM/FL functionality does not come without a price; these complex decision-making algorithms required for PM/FL are difficult to specify, develop, and test, It is also important to note that the effectiveness of Seawolf PM/FL is directly attributed to the redundancy inherent in the fault-tolerant design. The paper describes how this approach has evolved from earlier submarines and some of the experiences to date with Seawolf PM/FL testing and Seawolf ship control maintenance. The paper also summarizes the design of the system, discussing the features of the fault-tolerant architecture that facilitate effective maintenance. The difficulties involved in the specification, design, and exhaustive verification of PM/FL will be described. Some speculations as to how future systems might benefit from automated maintenance features is included.

AB  - Tolerances define the limits of the allowed variation in part size. This allowed variation from the nominal dimension is undesirable, but necessary since it is recognized that a part cannot be made exactly to a specified dimension. Tolerance analysis ensures that the final design meets all functional requirements by checking tolerance accumulation using a tolerance chart. An artificial intelligence solution to the tolerance chart is proposed, based on the assertion that problem solving is a process of symbol patterns to represent the problem domain, generating potential solutions from the symbol patterns, and searching the resultant state space for the best solution. The state space is represented as a tree graph showing the tolerance relations traditionally provided by a tolerance chart. A breadth-first search of this tree determines the dimensional chain and an algorithm calculates the stack-up tolerance between two features. A partial gear box assembly illustrates an application where the design tolerances are rejected because there is a possibility of no clearance between two mating parts.

AB  - Most motors are designed to operate for about 20 years, with proper maintenance, so longetivity should not be a problem. However, a large number of motors are not reaching their expected life. Through recently developed sensors and mathematical algorithms, several motor manufacturers are developing monitoring devices that will model, analyze, and predict the health of motors and other rotating machinery.

AB  - The future of computer technology has been discussed and according to Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers fellow Robert Hecht-Nielsen, HNC software cofounder and long-time artificial intelligence visionary, the future will be very different indeed. He contends that, by the year 2012, the computer industry will spawn several new industries with a cumulative size of 100 times today's computer industry and 10 times today's automobile industry. Everybody will have a computer and will be wearing it. The key products will be a laurel wreath, data glasses, a cone-of-silence microphone, and a pocket pack.

AB  - Deep Flight is a manned submersible designed for 3300 ft water depths, its design and operation are detailed. This article discusses the submersible and its future applications in the context of the manned versus unmanned submersibles debate. Lessons learned from the North Sea oil industry are considered. The author believes that it is not risk issues, but rather the relative costs and limitations of pilot placement which are the main issues. The performance advantages of manned vehicles are discussed.
Deep Flight is a manned craft submersible that frees researcher from support ships. The craft is seriously time-restrained by the endurance of its crew, but is wholly unrestrained in movement. Deep Flight is expected to be successful in its mission to preserve a viable manned option for the future of deep water exploration.

AB  - Virtual organizations are goal-driven associations of intellectual agents working within the information space. The development of virtual organizations and their agents is a natural continuation of the long movement in western society towards organizing for efficient commerce and communication. For at least 800 years cities and traditional organizations fulfilled these purposes, but now with the advent of high-speed communication and rich interconnectivity, a general diaspora of commerce and education may be expected. All of the technology needed to nurture the rise of virtual organizations is in place, albeit in a primitive form. The authors argue that in the next decade this technology will reach such a level of sophistication that traditional universities and schools with their massive physical assets will no longer be sustainable, and will be replaced by virtual organizations delivering education and training with a minimum of physical infrastructure.

AB  - Substations based on the IAIS (Intelligent Air-Insulated Substation) concept are built on small sites, require a minimum of maintenance, and exhibit high availability and reliability. In addition, advanced planning and engineering tools shorten the project lead times for the substations. At the center of the IAIS concept is a high-speed process bus for the communication between the switchgear and the control system. The concept was developed to meet the changing needs of the electric power industry as it adapts to market deregulation.

AB  - Naturally Fractured reservoir may have different characteristics from other non-fractured ones. Description of fractures distribution is the most importance in reservoir management because reservoir performance is strongly influenced by the fractures rather than the matrix system. It might be due to many geological phenomena, that had worked on the reservoir rocks so that some naturally fractured reservoirs become more complicated. The advancing science and technology enable us to apply the concept of dynamical system, using artificial neural network to fractured characterization of a fractured net-work characterization of a fractured reservoir. The objective of the study is to predict fractures network and the distribution in naturally fractured reservoir. A case study is performed using an actual field data set of Jatibarang volcanic reservoir.

AB  - KIDE-project has studied success factors and best practices in the Adaptive and Intelligent Systems Applications Programme projects, where techiques like neural nets, fuzzy locig and genetic algorithms are used. Application area expertise available to a project seems to be a critical success factor. Successful applying of a new technology is based on understanding application area needs and selecting applicable goals for the project. A system fulfilling meaningful need will most probably provide positive experience of the technique used. New techniques are often applied in co-operative projects, where understanding different roles and organizing co-operation are key factors. Co-operative athmosphere and flexible communication are highlighted. Development work progressing trough prototypes improves the end result and strenghtens productive feeling, when participants' motivation stays on a high level. Participants in a successfull team will likely work together also in coming projects, which builds a solid basis for continual productive co-operation. Considering re-usability of aimed results starting already at the project generation stage helps improving system to the product level. At the same time applied new technology becomes more optimically utilized in a broader context than only in one project.

AB  - This article looks closely at the ingredients of a compelling empirical evaluation. First, it presents thoughts on some of the advantages and disadvantages of 'bake-offs', or evaluations in which a number of researchers compare their work on a set of shared test problems. In recent years, this type of evaluation has found widespread use in large natural-language and machine-translation projects. Next, it describes how to design a set of compelling experiments through the use of both synthetic and real-world domains. Finally, it identifies some of the common pitfalls in analyzing the results of experiments and describes ways to avoid them.

AB  - In the no-holds-barred competition between Boeing and Europe's Airbus Industrie for dominance in the world's commercial jet airliner markets, the question of who--or what--is in charge in the cockpit has been a significant selling point. Airbus, which pioneered highly automated flight controls with its A320 narrow-body transport in the late 1980s, likes to emphasize the "protection" features built into the aircraft through those automated systems. Boeing, which employs many of the same concepts in its new 777 twin-engine widebody transport, tends to put more emphasis on crew involvement in the operation of that aircraft. Is there a difference? In fact, the question has broader implications than those involving the marketing battle between Boeing and Airbus. Airlines, aircraft manufacturers, flight training specialists, human factors gurus, and aviation authorities in various countries are struggling with the isse as automation becomes more and more prevalent on passenger and cargo-carrying aircraft around the world.

AB  - This paper reviews the results of research and development to establish an Artificial Intelligence/Expert System (AI/ES) pre-processor for Computational Electromagnetics (CEM) codes. The AI/ES-enhanced pre-processor, called the Intelligent Computational Electromagnetics Expert System (ICEMES), makes use of a commercially-available expert system and an existing government-developed CEM code. The present version was designed using Gensym's G2 Real Time Expert System and the US Air Force's General Electromagnetic Model for the Analysis of Complex Systems (GEMACS) program. Rationale for considering AI/ES technologies in the CEM pre-processor concept design include the ability to successfully merge various CEM software codes, physics/solution methods and processing algorithms, as well as establishing a common simulation environment which exploits code/data reuse and concurrent engineering methodologies. This environment employs rule-based and procedural techniques for knowledge incorporation, for establishing relationships among Knowledge Base (KB) components (objects), and for defining inherited properties for attributes sharing among various objects of the KB. The results of the ICEMES development and demonstration discussed in this paper are based on Phase I research performed by the authors under US Air Force Contract No. F30602-95-C-0198, sponsored under the DoD Small Business Innovation Research Program, Topic AF-055 entitled, "AI/ES Pre-processor for CEM".

AB  - There is a need in industry for intelligent and integrated control systems, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) to leverage expertise and knowledge for the optimization of the various processes within a business. Such system can provide coordinated and total management of all operational tasks, enhancing control, and giving that vital competitive edge that ensures profitability and survival in a highly competitive world. It is the application, integration and management of these systems, that has led to the concept of using a real-time expert system environment as a tool for implementing an intelligent and totally integrated control and management system.

AB  - Judgments of the effectiveness of single-subject behavioral interventions are often based on visual examination of graphs of response data, but previous research indicates that such judgments are often unreliable and flawed. Here it is proposed that artificial neural networks could be developed to simulate the judgments of expert judges. A prototype of such a network was designed and trained in the present study, and its use in novel experiments matched the estimates of the expert whose judgments were simulated significantly better than did a prediction equation developed using a multiple regression approach.

AB  - This study addresses the problems in evaluating nursing diagnostic artificial intelligence (AI) expert systems. Two separate experiments (N = 49) were conducted using a computer expert system. The first experiment, the "white box" experiment (n = 9), compared the diagnostic techniques applied by experience RNs against the programmed techniques used by the expert system. The second experiment, the "black box" experiment (n = 40), compared diagnostic results of beginning nurses against the computer expert systems results. In some cases the computer outperformed the nurses and vice versa. The evaluation techniques, as applied in both experiments, enhance the ability of nurses to evaluate and select AI expert systems to be used in computer-assisted diagnosis of nursing problems.

AB  - A framework of computational design method and modeling has been proposed for the layout and geometry design of complicated mechanical systems, which is named 'configuration network and its viewing control' in the first report. In this paper, we present a geometric modeling technique with the aim of its integration with the framework. In the modeling method, each geometry of an object entity is represented with a geometric primitive or a set of ones, and they are manipulated through form features such as positions, directions and dimensions, which are represented with symbol-based algebraic expressions. The restrictions and desirable states imposed by configurations on an artifact are translated into mathematical functions among the features, and those variables are fixed by an optimization calculation in order to embody the configurations into actual arrangements and geometries. Moreover, this model has an ability to partially analyze the consistency of configurations among geometric primitives with symbol-based algebraic expressions. Finally, some examples of its applications are briefly demonstrated in a design problem of air-conditioner units.

AB  - Reinforced concrete structures constitute a major portion of today's construction. The trend towards the use of reinforced concrete is more pronounced in both North America and Europe than in other parts of the world. Increased use of reinforced concrete necessarily requires installation of more and more reinforcing bars (re-bar). This paper presents a concept for process-oriented planning for the fabrication and placement of re-bar. Feature-based frameworks for design and planning are established to allow the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the development of a CAD-integrated process planning system for the placement of re-bar. A prototype system for feature-based and process-oriented re-bar placement planning is presented. The prototype system is implemented on a PC-486 by integrating AutoCAD, dBASE III PLUS and LEVEL5 OBJECT software. Finally, field testing of the process planning model in a real-world construction project and the results of the study are discussed.

AB  - Tecate is a new infrastructure on which applications can be constructed that allow end users to browse for and then visualize data within networked data sources. This software platform capitalizes on the architectural strengths of current scientific visualization systems, network browsers like Netscape, database management system front ends, and virtual reality systems. Applications layered on top of Tecate are able to browse for information in databases managed by database management systems and for information contained in the World Wide Web. In addition, Tecate dynamically crafts user interfaces and interactive visualizations of selected data sets with the aid of an intelligent system. This system automatically maps many kinds of data sets into a virtual world that can be explored directly by end users. In describing these virtual worlds, Tecate uses an interpretive language that is also capable of performing arbitrary computations and mediating communications among different processes.

AB  - The information presented comes from ASHRAE research project RP-642. The project has assembled, developed, and verified a knowledge base for the selection of heating, ventilating, and airconditioning (HVAC) system types for small office buildings in two climatic regions: cold and hot (or humid). The work includes the selection of the primary energy-conversion and distribution system types. A prototype knowledge-based system (KBS) has been developed to demonstrate the use of this knowledge base. Development of a KBS involves four basic tasks: knowledge acquisition, knowledge organization, programming, and verifying the program.

AB  - The eventual development of smart structural systems will require well-designed computational support for the signal processing and diagnostic inferencing associated with multi-channel instrumented structures. This paper discusses knowledge modeling issues and requirements for a smart structural system, and a logic-based object-oriented information architecture for organizing and managing the data arising from an instrumented structure is presented. A neural network is employed within this information architecture for damage identification. The resulting software implementation is described and illustrated in the context of a laboratory case study of damage detection in a successively damaged steel truss structure.

AB  - Clinical decision analysis seeks to identify the optimal management strategy by modelling the uncertainty and risks entailed in the diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of a particular problem or disorder. Decision trees are the most frequently used model in clinical decision analysis, but can be tedious to construct, cumbersome to use, and computationally prohibitive, especially with large, complex decision problems. We present a new method for clinical decision analysis that combines the techniques of decision theory and artificial intelligence. Our model uses a modular representation of knowledge that simplifies model building and enables more fully automated decision making. Moreover, the model exploits problem structures to yield better computational efficiency. As an example we apply our techniques to the problem of management of acute deep venous thrombosis.

AB  - Health care practitioners are often faced with the task of interpreting complex heart rhythms from electrocardiograms (ECGs) produced by 12-lead ECG machines, ambulatory (Holter) monitoring systems, and intensive-care unit monitors. Usually, the practitioner caring for the patient does not have specialized training in cardiology or in ECG interpretation; and commercial programs that interpret 12-lead ECGs have been well-documented in the medical literature to perform poorly at analyzing cardiac rhythm. We believe that a system capable of providing comprehensive ECG interpretation as well as access to online consultations will be beneficial to the health care system. We hypothesized that we could develop a client-server based telemedicine system capable of providing access to (1) an on-line knowledge-based system for remote diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias and (2) an on-line cardiologist for real-time interactive consultation using readily available resources on the Internet. Furthermore, we hypothesized that Macintosh and Microsoft Windows-based personal computers running an X server could function as the delivery platform for the developed system. Although we were successful in developing such a system that will run efficiently on a UNIX-based work-station, current personal computer X server software are not capable of running the system efficiently.

AB  - The use of artificial neural networks (ANN) for the identification of a positive correlation between the QuiOs quotient, a single-valued indicator of bone mineral density, and multisite dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measurements is described. The measurements were obtained using the Hologic QDRR-2000 x-ray bone densitometer in a multicenter clinical trial including 374 female patients. The QuiOs quotient estimates bone mineral density and determines the severity of bone density loss. This quotient is calculated by using a proprietary software program to perform a multivariate analysis of the results of testing of serum levels of calcium, phosphate, total alkaline phosphate, two alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes (liver and intestine), estradiol, and progesterone. The results show that given the four DEXA measurements obtained from the bone densitometer, the trained neural network can predict whether the corresponding QuiOs score of the same patient will be below the cutoff score of 0.690. The findings in this study indicate a positive correlation between DEXA measurements and the QuiOs quotient obtained from two different sources.

AB  - Researchers at the U.S. Bureau of Mines have developed an innovative approach to process control that combines the control capabilities of fuzzy logic, the search capabilities of genetic algorithms, and the modelling capabilities of neural networks. One of the key aspects of this approach to process control is the use of a neural network model to infer information from the physical system that cannot be measured directly with sensors. In the approach presented, a genetic algorithm is used in conjunction with a neural network model of a system and sensory information that is available to obtain needed information that cannot be measured directly. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on two specific systems from the mineral processing industry.

AB  - Time series data has become ubiquitous in artificial neural network applications. However, many researchers know little or nothing about the dynamics of the time series that they utilize. Techniques critical to network performance, such as windowing and number of hidden layers, often see parameters arbitrarily set. This paper reviews concepts for identifying and characterizing the dynamics of time series data. These techniques are presented as a means of acquiring a priori knowledge which can be used to improve network performance. An analysis strategy is presented as are the references necessary to further develop the ideas. The main goal is to get the reader thinking in terms of the traditional scientific triad: Understand, Predict, Control; in that order.

AB  - A number of developments in recent years offer promise of being able to detect minefields in militarily denied areas. Advances in terrain analysis and remote sensing at the Army Topographic Engineering Center at Fort Belvoir, VA, suggest that it is possible to localize and perhaps identify mine sites from safe altitudes. Advances being made in such areas as interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) use advanced radar and interferometry to produce high-resolution terrain elevation data. Expert systems emerging from research in artificial intelligence, new sensors, and the detailed terrain analyses they permit can help localize and reduce the areas which need to be searched. Another tool being exploited is the use of spectral signatures, i.e., reflected light signatures unique to the surface of the material. Computer software is also being used to detect minefields.

AB  - As libraries become repositories of computerized information, they follow the modern drift toward the quantification and, hence, the dehumanizing of knowledge and education. Because the computer excells at collecting, organizing, and "accessing" facts and data, its devotees may be promoting artificial intelligence at the expense of human understanding. Â© 1994.

AB  - The director of the National Center for Nursing Research (NCNR) challenged nurse scientists to develop substantive content in nursing knowledge domains and called for NCNR funding priorities to include both prevention of low-birth-weight infants and information system technologies (Hinshaw, 1989). To address this challenge, this study was the first in an ongoing program of informatics research in which artificial intelligence technology, called "machine learning," was used to develop and describe a knowledge base for preterm-birth risk assessment. This research should improve outcomes for childbearing families through the development of a knowledge base that provides improved decision support for nurses' preterm risk assessment. Accurate assessment of preterm-birth risk will permit intervention with appropriate educational programs, bed rest, and early symptom management to prolong gestation. Review of the literature found no conceptual or theoretical models of preterm birth risk. The lack of conceptual and theoretical models of preterm-birth risk may account for poor reliability and validity of existing preterm-birth risk screening instruments (Nunnally, 1978). Existing preterm risk screening instruments include factors that are not valid predictors of preterm-birth risk and fail to include factors reported in the literature that may be valid predictors of preterm birth (Alexander, Weiss, Hulsey, & Papiernik, 1991; Lockwood et al., 1991; Woolery, 1992). Although existing instruments are not adequately predictive of preterm risk, current preterm birth prevention programs use these invalid, unreliable tools to intervene with pregnant women on a daily basis. The outcomes where a women is incorrectly assessed "low risk" for preterm birth may result in preterm birth and delivery of an infant that dies or that requires expensive high technology to survive. The outcomes where a women is assessed "high risk" but does not actually manifest preterm birth may result in extra prenatal visits and more contact with perinatal nurses and physicians to provide education and assessment. However, the expense involved in extra prenatal visits is minimal compared with the costs of high technology and infant morbidity and mortality, resulting in a trend that increasingly treats all pregnant women as if they were "high risk" for preterm birth. Solutions to this problem may be found using machine-learning technology. Â© 1994.

AB  - The paper examines the use of knowledge-based techniques to generate a framework for the active rescheduling of an automated guided vehicle system in a manufacturing environment. Our approach to active rescheduling uses 'cues' drawn from events on the shop-floor to trigger rescheduling. Simulation experiments are used to capture knowledge about the shop-floor and various scheduling strategies. An extensible agent architecture is developed to facilitate active rescheduling.

AB  - This paper examines the main points of contact between logic programming and natural language processing, and covers some of the important issues that arise using logic programming techniques in natural language processing. It emphasizes the importance of taking into account the most general analyses from linguistic theory in building NLP systems, while also pointing out the need to adapt and combine the different theories to our ends, given that no single one can offer all- encompassing solutions. We concentrate on syntax, the most studied aspect of language processing. Our presentation of different approaches is centered whenever possible around treatment of one particular phenomenon, which serves as an axis of discussion throughout the article: long-distance dependencies between constituents.

AB  - Electronic medical records pose a challenge because of the complex types of data which are included. Decision support systems must be able to deal effectively with these data types. In the expert system demonstrated here, a diversity of data types are included. These data are processed by three different methods. However, the different methods of processing are transparent to the user. An overall rule-based interface integrates the different methods into one comprehensive system.

AB  - These days more and more banks are making significant use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to solve the needs of their clients. Most of today's workflow environments are semi-automated at best, and software applications are usually specific to document type and/or process. But to fully utilize the technologies available and make the workflow environment as automated and flexible as possible, AI systems will have to be more generic and object-oriented in nature. Within such an intelligent workflow environment, AI technologies are most significantly utilized for queue management and intelligent character recognition.

AB  - This article reports on a number of trends in roadway transportation, including increasing traffic congestion, emerging technology, and the increasing age of the driving population. It also considers aging of the highway infrastructure, and increasing heavy truck operations. This review is followed by speculations concerning the future of these trends and their likely impact on future safety, in particular the long-term effect of intelligent vehicle and highway systems (IVHSs). It is concluded that IVHS technologies may create a new awareness of safety issues, because system designers are forced to consider the limits of the human operator. Recent interest in the impairments associated with aging, based on the projected growth of this population segment, contributes to this awareness. Furthermore, the explosion of recent interest in IHVSs may provide a new opportunity for crash-avoidance countermeasures.

AB  - THE INCREASING SUCCESS of the computer has encouraged the use of computer-oriented language and mind-computer comparisons. The computational metaphor-the comparison of the mind/brain to the program/computer and the program/computer to the mind/brain-is now the dominant intellectual tool of many of the behavioral sciences. With the success of the computer, there have also been increased reports of computer-related physical disorders and psycho-social dysfunctions among computer users and workers. This paper argues that the human-computer relationship has become problematic, and the major reason for this is that people are confused about what is human and what is machine. The computational metaphor has so captured the imagination of some that they reject the present less-than-perfect world of the self and others for the perfect future world of the computer. The problem is exacerbated by the acceptance of the computational metaphor by many of those treating and educating these computer users and workers. Some scientists and thinkers have begun to explore and suggest alternative metaphors to better understand human intelligence and organizations and to improve the teaching of students' thinking skills. However, the computational metaphor cannot be easily dismissed. It has formidable theoretical and scientific support, as witnessed by the strength of the artificial intelligence movement and the unresolved AI debate. This paper concludes that the new discipline of computer criticism offers the beginning of a resolution to the issue by locating the computer and the computational metaphor within the larger context of cultural language and thought.

AB  - The methods and means used for knowledge representation in interactive systems were systematized. The main requirements for the model of knowledge representation were determined. Comparative analysis of different models was made, and their merits and demerits were discussed. The models should reflect the status of the universe of discourse and determine the concrete conditions of dialogue, its content, as well as the syntaxes, semantic and semiotic instruments of the dialogue realization.

AB  - The rapid development of computer techniques has now made further developments possible in the principles of control using a written program, namely, the design of intelligent information exchange networks where, instead of traditional switches, one uses artificial-intelligence multiprocessor structures. A characteristic feature of the various microprocessor switches is the fact that they must simultaneously process many high-rate data flows, i.e., they must operate in real time. This paper proposes an algorithm that enables one to obtain the structure and specific apparatus and software suitable for setting up a highly reliable real-time microprocessor switching device.

AB  - The basic tendency of interactive information systems development in the present decade is the application of artificial intelligence methods. For this purpose, the expert systems now under development should contain an extensive set of physico-chemical and mathematical models. The two-decade experience of the steel metallurgy department of the Moscow Institute for Steel and Alloys in physical and mathematical simulation of steel making processes demonstrates, that strictly deterministic models with distinct limitation of allowable fields of application are still prevalent. In developing the set of physico-chemical and mathematical models for the 'Metallurgy' data bank, it is advisable to follow a more universal approach, allowing to describe all the existing metallurgical processes on a single basis. In order to achieve it, one should abandon statistical and formal mathematical models and to rest on an adequate space-time description of physico-chemical processes in the simulated unit. The practice demonstrates, that all metallurgical processes are nonequilibrium with the presence of essentially dissimilar zones, often with opposite directions of reactions in them. As this takes place, each of these zones is open with respect to the process as a whole, while in certain zones the reactions may be characterized as virtually equilibrium, stationary nonequilibrium, and nonstationary nonequilibrium (transitional towards equilibrium or the steady state or near-stationary). The thermodynamics of irreversible processes is able to become the universal approach to describing such complex systems. The application of the local equilibrium principle is considered in detail with the use of experimental data on melting in high-capacity converters KarMK and NLMK.

AB  - This investigation determines the economic feasibility of automating select earthmoving equipment used atop hazardous waste landfills. The prime motive for this is to avoid potential health hazards to the equipment operators. A thorough analysis has been made of the tasks performed by equipment, and the functions that need to be automated. Teleoperated systems have been chosen for automating the landfill equipment, primarily because the technical know-how is already available in the market, in contrast to artificial intelligence methods, which have not been completely developed yet. It is believed that automating the equipment will result in economic savings to the landfill owner, provided that productivity is not adversely affected. However, productivity losses are a serious concern, and if proper productivity control is not exercised, the economic risks could more than offset the benefits.

AB  - Applications combining robotics and vision often need to deal with recognition of 3 D objects. Classical solutions to such problems are based on complex methods using model matching. The main drawbacks of these methods are computational complexity and the need for object modeling. Such approaches are not always justified, and the authors propose a method which is fast and easy to use. A neural network is trained to recognize various views of many objects. Once trained, it can recognize new views. In order to reduce the volume of data, the objects are described by their silhouette. After a description of the proposed method, we present many experimental results related to robot vision.

AB  - In this article, we present on original approach for the localization of objects in an image. Our approach is neuronal and it includes two steps. In the first step, a rough localization is performed by presenting each pixel with its neighbourhood to a neural net which is able to indicate if this pixel and its neighbourhood are the image of the search object. This first filter is not very discriminant for the position. From its result, we can select areas which might contain an image of the object. In the second step, these areas are presented to another neural net which can determine the exact position of the object in each area. We apply this algorithm to the problem of localizing faces in images.

AB  - To realize the visual, intelligent and personal communication world, the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) has developed a network evolution plan towards the 21st century. Introduction of fibre-optic (FO) systems to all customers, especially to the home and to small business customers, is the key step towards the next generation network. Accordingly, NTT plans to introduce FO systems widely to the home from around 1995 and to achieve an all-fibre subscriber network by 2015. This article discusses the deployment and development concept of fibre to the home (FTTH) and highlights opticalization and evolution scenarios. It also proposes network services which should be offered upon FO subscriber system deployment. FTTH system configurations and deployment strategies are also detailed.

AB  - New high-current, high-precision microprocessor-controlled power supplies, built by Alpha Scientific Electronics of Hayward, CA, have been installed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Accelerator Complex. Each unit has sophisticated microprocessor control on-board and communicates via Rs-422 (serial communications). The units use a high level ASCII-based control protocol. Performance tests were conducted to verify adherence to specification and to ascertain ultimate long-term stability. The âfront-endâ software used by the accelerator control system has been written to accommodate these new devices. The supplies are interfaced to the control system through a terminal server port connected to the site-wide ethernet backbone. Test design and results as well as details of the software implementation for the analog and digital control of the supplies through the accelerator control system are presented. Â© 1993 IEEE

AB  - Power transmission network design is a promising application area for artificial intelligence techniques. Recently, several attempts have been made to integrate conventional numerical algorithms with more ambitious decision support systems. In this paper, we present SELF, a knowledge-based system supporting a specific task in power transmission network design known as `load-flow analysis'. SELF is the result of long-term co-operation in this field between CISE and the Electric Research Centre of ENEL (the Italian Electricity Board). It integrates a heuristic search approach to the design task with conventional numerical algorithms within the framework of a `propose-critique-modify' design methodology. The aim of the system is to help the designer interpret numerical results and take design decisions. SELF has been tested on networks of significant size (up to 420 nodes and 600 connections) and is currently used by ENEL researchers.

AB  - Previously identified and current trends in the development of computer systems and in the use of computers for health care applications are reviewed. Trends identified in a 1982 article were increasing miniaturization and archival ability, increasing software costs, increasing software independence, user empowerment through new software technologies, shorter computer-system life cycles, and more rapid development and support of pharmaceutical services. Most of these trends continue today. Current trends in hardware and software include the increasing use of reduced instruction- set computing, migration to the UNIX operating system, the development of large software libraries, microprocessor-based smart terminals that allow remote validation of data, speech synthesis and recognition, application generators, fourth-generation languages, computer-aided software engineering, object-oriented technologies, and artificial intelligence. Current trends specific to pharmacy and hospitals are the withdrawal of vendors of hospital information systems from the pharmacy market, improved linkage of information systems within hospitals, and increased regulation by government. The computer industry and its products continue to undergo dynamic change. Software development continues to lag behind hardware, and its high cost is offsetting the savings provided by hardware.

AB  - The telecommunications world is changing rapidly. Great efforts are put into the development of Managed Transport Networks like the Ericsson Transport Network Architecture (ETNA), in order to gradually replace today's fixed transmission systems. In the switching area, the concept of Intelligent Networks is gaining ground. When introducing Intelligent Networks systems, it is essential to have access systems for advanced customer services capable of following the migration path from PDH to SDH and from service-dedicated exchanges to multi-service nodes. That is why Ericsson now provides a series of access systems for use together with AXE exchanges, the ETNA transport network system and the TMOS telecom management platform. The authors describe the DIAmuX System Series, a number of Flexible Access Systems for Integrated Access, developed to interwork directly with ETNA and AXE. DIAmuX is an Ericsson solution to managed and flexible, integrated access.

AB  - High performance materials require closely controlled parameters throughout their processing and analysis. Recent work has shown that highly automated supercritical fluid (SF) instrumentation may be used to develop new carbon fiber/fabric coating processes, as well as to provide on-line characterization information. Solubilization of thermoplastic oligomers in SF liquid carbon dioxide (ranges 340 to 680 atm (5000 to 10,000 psi) and 80Â°C to 120Â°C) is followed by controlled depressurization onto selected fiber or composite substrates. High modulus carbon materials are coated with selected polymeric formulations in this novel means to surface treat or impregnate composites. The commercial SF instrumentation may be configured to automate on-line chemical analysis using a range of chromatographic or spectral detectors, such as mass (MS) or Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers. In combination with applied artificial intelligence tools, the systems illustrate the Integrated Intelligent Instrument (I3) approach to trace organic analysis. Applications of SF technology use fully formulated fluoropolymers and epoxies in studies of composition, coating, and curing operations, as well as to evaluate specialty carbon fiber thermal treatments.

AB  - Automatic Target Recognition in image processing often relies on a model or on an interpretation process based on a combination of information data and artificial intelligence techniques. The method proposed in this paper is to automatically recognize a target when you only have a picture of it. Furthermore, it is assumed that the location and attitude parameters of the sensor used to obtain the image in which we want to recognize the target are not known with great precision, and that this precision does not allow image to image recording. The only request asked for by the automatic target recognition algorithm is to know where the target is in the original picture and from which viewpoint the first picture was taken.

AB  - The paper deals with the problem of combining of partial forecasts on the basis of both models and expert discourses. Both deterministic and probabilistic statements are considered in accordance with the degree of uncertainty. The linear programming method is used for the solution of the problem. In statistical statement the partial forecasts are considered as random variables with given distributions and the likelihood of expert information is interpreted as subjective probabilities. The maximum entropy principle is used for overcoming the uncertainty. Two typical examples are considered. The first one concerns the case when the errors of partial forecasts have normal distribution and the second one - when the errors have two-sided exponential (Laplace) distribution.

AB  - IMTS will be a show full of automation opportunities, builders say, and the automation on view will be flexible. They differ on the meaning of flexible, however. Manufacturing cells for prismatic parts have evolved into highly productive and cost-effective solutions for JIT, small lots, and quality control. The same techniques must be applied and accepted in turning cells. The article addresses concepts such as families of parts, the basic CNC machine; controls and programming; gaging, materials.

AB  - Rapid clearing of mine fields with minimum hazard to operating personnel requires that multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) be used. High probability of detection and correct classification with low false alarm rates and accurate location must be achieved to make autonomous mine-hunting operations successful. The technical approach uses multiple algorithms and neural networks to achieve a higher probability of detection and lower false alarm rate than can be achieved with any single algorithm. Each detected area of the image is classified to determine whether or not the area has a high probability of containing mine-like versus natural objects. Classification is accomplished by implementing decision formulas that imitate the rules used by experienced sonar operators/analysts when searching for mines.

AB  - It is noted that Popper separates the creation of concepts, conjectures, hypotheses and theories-the context of invention-from the testing thereof-the context of justification-arguing that only the latter is susceptible of rigorous logical analysis. Efforts on the part of others to shift or eradicate the demarcation established by this distinction are discussed and the relationship of these considerations to the claims of "strong artificial intelligence" is pointed out. It is argued that the mode of education of scientists, as well as reports of celebrated scientists, support Popper's judgement in this matter. An historical episode from Faraday's later career is used to illustrate the historiographical strength of Lakatos' "methodology of research programs." Â© 1992 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - It is very difficult to build a knowledge base in the mechanical engineering field. Because there is a great deal of complicated knowledge in mechanical engineering in comparison with other engineering fields. To build a large knowledge base, much research to connect Data Base System (DBS) and Knowledge Base System (KBS) systematically has been conducted. DBS is suitable for storing much knowledge but is not suitable for the representation of knowledge. Therefore, we believe it is possible in the mechanical engineering field to realize DBS characters in KBS by using an extended deamon function and extended system slot. If this system is realized, KBS will be suitable for managing and representing knowledge, and it will be easy to build a knowledge base in the mechanical engineering field. This paper describes the method of building a large knowledge base in mechanical engineering using an extended daemon function and an extended system slot, and âthe realization of such a knowledge baseâ.

AB  - NASA's Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence presents unique challenges for data acquisition and analysis. During the proposed Microwave Observing Project each MultiChannel Spectrum Analyser (MCSA) system will process more than 60 million bytes of information every second. To prevent a backlog of data and to avoid delays in the confirmation of potential signals, the data will be processed in real time with special purpose hardware and software. The software is required to control and coordinate the hardware systems and the data that they produce. The performance of the system must be continuously monitored to assure that the search achieves maximum sensitivity, minimum contamination by Radio Frequency Interference, and optimal use of observing resources. We have developed a prototype data acquisition system that has been used in field tests of a prototype MCSA and software signal detection algorithms. The system, called VERA 2.0, is based on virtually concurrent communication software processes within a single computer. A new version under development will use several independent computers, communicating over a network. Each computer will be responsible for a portion of the data processing. Some techinques of artificial intelligence will be used to evaluate potential signals during the observation. Â© 1992.

AB  - This paper presents the preliminary development of a method for monitoring the propulsion system and identifying correct recovery procedures for the F404 engine in support of the F-18 high-angle-of-attack research vehicle program. By using artificial intelligence techniques and modern display technology, we have been able to design a system that aids in real-time monitoring of propulsion systems. This expert system is designed to operate as an âexpert aidâ to an engineer with little or no experience in propulsion system monitoring. The goals of this expert system development project are to provide enhanced safety of flight and to relieve the propulsion engineers of the time-consuming but necessary task of propulsion system monitoring on flight programs, particularly those with nonexperimental engines. As telemetry data is received, the results are continually being displayed to the engineer in a unique manner. The engineer has the choice of a number of different color graphical displays he may use. These include being able to monitor the engine state, monitor individual parameters and watch time histories or strip chart displays. When an anomaly is identified, that information is displayed to the engineer. Any additional information is also displayed, such as the procedures necessary to recover from the anomaly.

AB  - Analog very large-scale integrated (VLSI) technology can be used not only to study and simulate biological systems, but also to emulate them in designing artificial sensory systems. A methodology for building these systems in CMOS VLSI technology has been developed using analog micropower circuit elements that can be hierarchically combined. Using this methodology, experimental VLSI chips of visual and motor subsystems have been designed and fabricated. These chips exhibit behavior similar to that of biological systems, and perform computations useful for artificial sensory systems.

AB  - Real-time aircraft testing is increasing in both frequency and complexity. Greater demands are being placed on flight test engineers to simultaneously monitor aircraft systems during flight and to perform problem analysis real time. This has caused a rise in requirements for automated and intelligent monitoring systems. The use of state-of-the-art off-the-shelf hardware and software has provided a cost effective base for supporting development of real-time expert systems to aid in these monitoring tasks. A brief introduction to the telemetry environment is given. This is followed by descriptions of some specific applications including a propulsion monitor. The final section discusses some aspects of knowledge engineering and an inherent conflict between knowledge engineering and software engineering.

AB  - Since the process of mechanically generating a text can be simulated as though it was that of human writing, generation of an English text in this paper is conducted through the use of the world knowledge and the real materials of English texts dependent knowledge as well as his linguistic knowledge. Technically, despite difference in nature, the two bodies of knowledge - the semastic representation corresponding to writer's thoughts and his conceptual dictionaries as background knowledge - are combined to be given a common means by which their meanings are expressed. The another entity is also important, and we define this comprehensive knowledge as real data dependent knowledge. The common means is called Contextual Representation Structure(CRS). The characteristic of CRS is used effectively for every stage of text generation from entablishing the general framework of a text determining the specific details. Study is made to explore over more than one paragraph, whose generation has rarely been attempted. The successful generation requires consideration of contextual coherence throughout the entire paragraphs. The structured semantic expression is related to rules for generating a coherent text of multiple paragraphs because contextual connections of the paragraphs are based upon the structure of their semantic representation. The system of English text generation is loaded a mechanical Japanese-English translation system, to see how the process of text generation actually works. A monitoring output of a text generation process of this system is presented.

AB  - Integrated with artificial intelligence techniques such as conceptual inductive inference, intelligent databases can become important sources of knowledge for both humans and expert systems in various application domains. Transformation of data into knowledge through conceptual induction has been the focus of the research described in this paper. We present a conceptual inductive methodology KNOWD (KNOWledge-Directed) for creating inductive databases which can provide to its users not only the data itself but also conceptual descriptions of the physical entities the data represent, and the relationships among these physical entities. Acquisition and representation of concepts are directed by domain knowledge, and inductive biases are employed to guide the inductive process. With two phases of abstractions as well as a bias management system, the KNOWD methodology can be applied to a wide spectrum of domains. We have implemented an inductive database system (IDB1) which employs the KNOWD methodology. A generalization data model, based on an object-oriented data model, has also been developed and employed to support the inductive generalizations. IDB1 has been tested by employing rocket engine test data. A description of the test examples and results is also given in this paper.

AB  - The paper deals with the testing of hypothesis about prediction-optimization mechanism (of some class) of human operator actions and semi-formalized universal model of operator actions (MOA). The model is based on the extension of the generalized work minimum principle (for multiextremal problems) and on the comparison with several known empirical models and results. The ways of further development and application of MOA are described. Proposed mechanism includes the prediction of free motion of controlled object. The procedures of the search for global minimum are not formalized completely because of uncertainty of adequate human actions. Four levels of operator actions are distinguished. The author indicates that proposed model is not more than hypothesis. The realization of the concept of optimal electronic instructor can serve as one of the methods of its verification. If automatic learning systems constructed by means of this principle are sufficiently efficient then proposed MOA go through additional test and can be used in man-machine systems.

AB  - The paper deals with the formalism in description, statements and methods for the solution of the problems of fuzzy linear programming. The theory of possibility and fuzzy set theory are used for the description of the problems. This approach enables to model adequately the uncertainty of parameters of the models of linear programming. The paper develops the approach to the problem of fuzzy optimization with the help of possibility theory axiomatic. The methods for the solution of fuzzy linear programming problems are reduced to the substitution of initial problems by equivalent deterministic ones. Various statements and methods for the solution of the linear programming problems with fuzzy variables are described. The modelling of random fuzzy data is carried out with the help of discrete fuzzy variables. The values of random variables are tolerant fuzzy variables. The architecture of intelligent system for decision making on the basis of fuzzy linear programming methods is described. Proposed methods can be realized on the basis of linear programming.

AB  - The procedures for planning of integral robot operations in various conditions are considered. The solution of the problem under linguistic uncertainty is based on the use of deductive decision making procedures. The problem environment is described by fuzzy semantic networks with high dimension. The essence of proposed method is in decomposition of current and goal environmental situation. Further, obtained local subproblems are solved on the basis of standard microprograms connected with the achievement of given global goal. The description of the structure of fuzzy semantic networks and microprograms of behaviour is given. The procedures for the choice of the standard microprogram in the decision making process are constructed. The analysis of decision making procedures shows the possibility of their application for the planning of operations in complicated conditions.

AB  - AFTER MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF NEGLECT, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are emerging as a strong contender in artificial intelligence. However, researchers whose leanings are more toward expert systems or other types of symbolic formalisms for knowledge representations warn against overly enthusiastic claims depicting ANNs as replicating the process of human thinking. While some of these objections are justified, the technology warrants a closer look by designers of educational software. Though neural networks are usually considered as a part of artificial intelligence, they are very different from the AI formalisms to which weâre accustomed. Expert systems use if-then rules to arrive at an answer. These rules are formulated by a knowledge engineer who works closely with a content expert to derive a model of the problem space. Neural networks, however, are fed sample cases (called âtraining setsâ), learn how to recognize patterns in the sample data, and then use this experience in handling new cases. Because neural nets are trained rather than programmed, the only overhead â other than the initial design â is in collecting and formatting the data sets (Carlson, 1990b, p. 50). This paper first describes the essentials of how an ANN learns, using a classic application in pattern recognition to demonstrate an operating ANN. Of the several âcognitiveâ roles ANNs are suitable for, two seem especially appropriate for computer-mediated education: (1) intelligent filters and (2) spreading, associative memories. To illustrate each, I describe prototypes Iâm working on at the Air Force Armstrong Laboratory. Â© 1991, Springer. All rights reserved.

AB  - The application of the BOXES paradigm to continuous, non failing systems seems anomalous. The paper discusses such an application with special reference to a simulation of a trash to steam plant. The paper indicates cost savings attributable to intelligent control and opens for discussion real time BOXES applications for poorly or non-definable systems. The BOXES method must be modified to accommodate endless operation and focuses on the notion of augmenting a safe, non optimal system with AI generated control values. The paper compares the resulting plant performance to that of a simple rule based algorithm and a random idiot exercising the same control authority as BOXES. Â© 1992.

AB  - A pertinent, legible and complete medical record facilitates good patient care. The recording of the symptoms, signs and lab findings which are relevant to a patient's condition contributes importantly to the medical record. The consideration and documentation of other disease states known to be related to the patient's primary illness provide further enhancement. We propose that developing sets of disease-specific core elements which a physician may want to document in the medical record can have many benefits. We hypothesize that for a given disease, terms with high importance (TI) and frequency (TF) in the DX-plain, QMR and Iliad knowledge bases (KBs) are terms which are used commonly in the medical record, and may be, in fact, terms which physicians would find useful to document. A study was undertaken to validate ten such sets of disease-specific core elements. For each of ten prevalent diseases, high TI and TF terms from the three KBs mentioned were pooled to derive the set of core elements. For each disease, all patient records (range 385 to 16,972) from a computerized ambulatory medical record database were searched to document the actual use by physicians of each of these core elements. A significant percentage (range 50 to 86%) of each set of core elements was confirmed as being used by the physicians. In addition, all medical concepts from a selection of full text records were identified, and an average of 65% of the concepts were found to be core elements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - A representation is described for two-dimensional anatomic shapes which can be described by single-valued distortions of a circle. The representation, called a radial contour model, is both generic, in that it captures the expected shape as well as the range of variation for an anatomic shape class, and flexible, in that the model can deform to fit an individual instance of the shape class. The model is implemented in a program called SCANNER (version 0.61) for 2-D interactive image segmentation and matching. An initial evaluation was performed using 7 shape models learned from a training set of 93 contours, and a control model containing no shape knowledge. Evaluation using 60 additional contours showed that in general the shape knowledge should reduce interactive segmentation time by a factor of two over the control, and that for specific shapes such as the eye, the improvement is much greater. A matching function was also devised which showed that the radial contour model should allow diagnosis of subtle shape changes. These results suggest that the use of spatial anatomic knowledge, when combined with good interactive tools, can help to alleviate the segmentation bottleneck in medical imaging. The models, when extended to more complex shapes, will form the spatial component of a knowledge base of anatomy that could have many uses in addition to image segmentation.

AB  - The University Hospital Consortium is collecting clinical, administrative and financial data from its members to develop a Clinical Information Network. The value of this collective data lies in how comparative information about peer hospitals and physicians in the same specialty can be used to influence practice. The raw data from each hospital is analyzed, classified, normalized and stored in a data repository which is easily accessible. This data becomes information when it is presented in a variety of ways, and is supported by a knowledge-base of health care rules. The "drilling down" technique to progressive levels of detail serves the needs of all levels in the organization--executives, managers, and analysts. The system combines the power of a mainframe for the data repository with the ease of use of a PC-based workstation. With an open-ended approach, the users can ask a variety of questions of the data, as well as perform statistical analysis, create graphical presentations and generate explanations of the analysis techniques.

AB  - Physicians in various subspecialties routinely perform physical examinations of the back and extremities utilizing their understanding of peripheral anatomy, extremity kinesiology, and neuro- musculo-ligamentous pathologies. We are developing a HyperCard computer application which combines text, graphics, and sound to teach, review, and test functional limb anatomy and kinesiology in an independent, non-confrontational, user-friendly environment. The software incorporates principles which maximize learning, runs on hardware accessible to most people, encourages independent learning and self evaluation, and utilizes links which take advantage of the network structure inherent to anatomy.

AB  - Issues as diverse as occupational safety, waste minimization, and product quality are forcing the Department of Energy (DOE) to increase the level of automation in its defenseâproduction facilities. In this paper, we describe the development necessary to allow a specific automation technologyâthe standard industrial robotâto be used effectively in DOE manufacturing operations. We describe Sandia's research and development efforts on automated planning and programming, and on programming models and languages for âintelligentâ manufacturing systems that use robots. We conclude by discussing the application of these concepts to machines and processes other than robots. We also mention how these technologies affect the more general manufacturingâtechnology base. Â© 1991 AT&T Technical Journal

AB  - Customer expectations regarding the performance of intelligent digital networks can be met only if careful consideration is given to synchronization at every level in the network. This includes synchronization of the public switched and private networks, and performance of the clocks that control customer premises equipment (CPE). Poor synchronization planning at the public or private network level, as well as poor CPE clock performance can degrade customer applications such as video, facsimile, digital data, encryption, voiceâband data, and voice transmission. In this paper, we consider the synchronization philosophies and implementation of both AT&T's national telecommunications network and private customerâowned networks. We will also discuss the performance of typical CPE clocking systems and describe the synchronization systems used in AT&T's line of DefinityÂ® business communications systems.

AB  - This paper presents an application of artificial intelligence programming methods to the problem of scheduling in a prototype job-shop. A rule-based approach has been adopted to develop a three-level hierarchical decision structure within the system. The rules representing various objects and behavioral relations among these objects were coded in PROLOG. The system can be used in two ways: 1) to predict shop behavior through handling resource allocation, sequencing and scheduling decisions, 2) to enable to modify the current schedule based on up-to-date information such as unexpected machine breakdowns.

AB  - Applicative computer systems (ACS) constructed sequentially (according to Gentsen) with a limited rule of section as deductive extensions of calculi of Î» the Church conversion and pure combinatory Sheifinkel-Carry logic are studied. ACS properties are studied which permit to consider the ACS in a whole as paranoncontradictive intellectual systems of computer logics. The section rule admittance is proved directly without appealing to the shift lemma in some classes of conclusions. In the case the induction is carried out by analogy with the corresponding formula of the predicate logics language. The rules of cancellation from conclusion construction are excluded without decreasing generality. The ACS possibilities are investigated in relation to known arithmetic and theoretical-set calculus.

AB  - A prototype decision-support expert system for bulk power system restoration is presented in this paper. The expert system is able to give correct and effective schemes for restoration of units, network and loads under various fault conditions. With hierarchical knowledge structure, hybrid intellegence reasoning/numerical calculation mode, and minimum restoration time criterion for conflict resolution, the expert system can run at higher speed, generate better schemes, and has potential resources for extensibility, maintainability and portability.

AB  - Operations systems have helped telephone operating companies automate manual operations, reduce reliance on paper records, and run their networks more cost effectively. But these computer-based systems will face new challenges with the emergence of the intelligent network. The new network will bring many extraordinary services, faster introduction of services, and services tailored to end-users' needs. Operations systems must be able to respond to this complexity. To help meet these challenges, AT&amp;T offers operations systems that let telcos program their own operations services. It has also launched two systems that keep an eye on the entire network: the Total Network Surveillance Integrator and the Network Traffic Manager. To focus on service operations, AT&amp;T has also announced the A-I-NetTM Service Management System.

AB  - Two alternative directions can be distinguished in current call processing research - the provision of development tools to manage the complexity of the code, and the use of declarative programming techniques to constrain that complexity. The latter has had some limited success, but has failed to produce a complete solution due to the difficulty of modelling the environment within which each facility request has to be satisfied. To declaratively model this environment requires not only the representation of the current state of physical resources, but also the representation of the actions that the system has taken, is taking, or will take toward the satisfaction of its many concurrent facility requests. The research outlined in this paper solves that problem by using artificial intelligence (AI) planning techniques to satisfy user facility requests, and by making the generated plans available as a declarative model of the system's state. The approach is validated through the production of a working prototype.

AB  - Design engineers for piping in nuclear power stations have to pay special attention to safety and reliability, and account for specific requirements such as system functions, plant operability and structural strength. The large amount of pipes used over 500 km in length requires many expertized engineers for its design and many hours of effort for engineering. IHI has already effectively applied integrated computer systems for productional engineering. These efforts have greatly effected on stability in design and savings in manpower. Currently, it is remarkable that expert systems which utilize the technology of artificial intelligence are being utilized in various fields. IHI developed the expert system in order to deal with the complicated piping design in nuclear power stations. This paper describes the outline of the expert system which was completed as the prototype.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and techniques to management science problems. A rich variety of commercial AI software products is now emerging to facilitate this. However, there has been little integration between AI and Management Science (MS) at a theoretical level. This paper proposes the use of formal logic as the basis for this conceptual bridge, and the use of logic programming as a modeling language for management science applications. The framework is illustrated by a logic-based representation, called PM, for specifying production, distribution and inventory problems. Â© 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - A new maintenance technique which is called the machine condition diagnosis technique is attracting attention, and, using this technique, a changeover is taking place from the former time-based maintenance to condition-based maintenance. The method of diagnosis of rotating machines using vibration analysis is one of the most effective techniques. The authors attempted to apply this method to the maintenance of railway vehicles and developed a method of diagnosing railway vehicle equipment without dismantling it. Vibration analysis, which is a means of judging the internal defectiveness of a machine by measuring the vibration from outside requires skill, so an attempt was made to systematize the diagnosis method for rotating machines by using an expert system. This report gives an outline of a prototype system developed on an AI workstation and a personal computer with the Interlisp-DJ programming language and an object-oriented building tool called CSRL.

AB  - Research on automating the analysis of nonlinear ordinary differential equations by combining artificial intelligence techniques with existing numerical software is discussed. A program called POINCARE that analyzes one-parameter autonomous planar systems at the level of experts through a combination of theoretical dynamics, numerical simulation, and geometrical reasoning is described. The input is the system, a bounding box for the system state, a bounding interval for the parameter, and error tolerances. POINCARE partitions the parameter interval into open subintervals of equivalent behavior bounded by bifurcation points, classifies the bifurcation points, and constructs representative phase diagrams for the subintervals. It detects local and global generic one-parameter bifurcations. It constructs the phase diagrams by identifying fixed points, saddle manifolds, and limit cycles and partitioning the remaining trajectories into open regions of uniform asymptotic behavior. It is explained how to extend POINCARE to two-parameter families of periodically driven planar equations. The basic algorithms carry over after some modifications and extensions. A survey of open issues in the automatic analysis of other dynamical systems is given. Â© 1990.

AB  - A novel approach for optimizing the geometrical shape of an object designed to extremize a set of performance criteria is developed and applied to the problem of optimizing the shape of a cold neutron source. First, an analogy is drawn between the shape optimization problem and a state space search, which is one of the fundamental problems in artificial intelligence applications. Then, a description is given of the implementation of this new approach into the computer code DAIT in which the physical model is represented by a two-group, r-z geometry nodal diffusion method, and the search is conducted via a truncated breadth-first algorithm. This algorithm reduces to the traditional nearest neighbor algorithm if the search breadth is truncated at one.

AB  - Piloting large vessels in increasingly congested waterways is no simple task. As in many scenarios involving decision making under uncertainty, masters, mates, and pilots engaged in piloting are inundated with much information and must make crucial decisions in real time. Piloting is also an inherently judgmental activity. Pilots and ship's captains invariably develop heuristics for transiting particular waterways. As vessels become larger, cargoes more hazardous, and the waterways more congested, decision aid technology is being considered to improve piloting decision making. This paper describes one approach to providing improved onâboard decision support to masters, mates on watch, and pilots navigating in restricted waters. We discuss (1) the use of cognitive decision aids in piloting, (2) the design of such a decision aid developed for New York harbor, and (3) the transition of the system from an offâline prototype to an operational shipboard expert system for tankers transiting the Gulf of Alaska. 1990 Institute of Navigation

AB  - Three quite different but complementary agenda for research on inferential networks are discussed in this paper. The first agendum is that of an American jurist who seems to have been the first to study inference networks. The second is held by several persons currently active in the application of Bayesian inference networks within artificial intelligence. The third belongs to the author and it involves study of a variety of evidential and inferential subtleties that are exposed in inference network analyses. Also discussed are structural, probabilistic, and behavioral issues that arise in the analysis of inference networks; not all of these issues are commonly recognized.

AB  - In nuclear power plants, one the most effective means of early failure detection is based on the analysis of reactor noises. Diagnostic expert system aimed at early failure detection should include the knowledge coming from experience expressed in rules, and the functional knowledge expressed in structural as well as qualitative and quantitative models of different principle. Appropriate formalization of these types of knowledge is essential for the effectiveness of the diagnostic inference process, i.e. for the success of the diagnostics. In the diagnostic system under development the primary means of knowledge representation is an object oriented programming environment based on a Lisp dialect. The system describing the structure and the behaviour of a nuclear block and the inference mechanism utilizing it, are built on that and the evaluating mechanism of the Lisp.

AB  - ISDN services offer network operators the opportunity to increase revenues, but at the same time careful planning and analysis are essential to ensure that services are likely to prove successful. Structured scenario analysis based on qualitative data and the opinions of experts offers an effective approach that helps plan new services and minimises the risks associated with implementation. The author describes an expert system known as CLASS (for crisp and linguistic analysis of structured scenarios), which has been developed to support, model, and analyse the introduction and planning of ISDN services. An important feature of CLASS is that it does not take the traditional optimistic approach which assumes that all planned services will take off, but rather performs a careful analysis of the alternatives, uncertainties, and risks involved.

AB  - THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT of a Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI) tool for learning management decision-making using advanced and traditional Computer Information Systems (CIS) technologies. Professors from Russia and the United States developed this tool, which differs substantially from earlier CAI systems in several ways: 1.It is cross-nationally useful since it has been used in Russia and the United States with the respective language modules integrated into the same tool, therefore, accommodating language differences 2.It focuses on management decision-making learning as well as technical skills learning 3.It integrates competitive (free) market and economic (controlled market) concepts and analysis 4.It is able to measure not only results accurately but also, by increasing before and after tutorial answers, measure the impact of the system on the user's ability to correctly reply to questions; and 5.It combines traditional computer technologies with artificial intelligence/expert system technologies.

N1  - Funding textÂ 1:Â systems, artificial intelligence, and free market strategic planning. At that time, they studied the possibility of joint research projects with professors from Moscow State University, involving their two areas: computer-aided instruction (in Russia) and expert systems/free market planning (in the United States). This initial discussion and work led to a 1996 grant which funded the Russian professor's three-months stay in New York working at St. John's University with the American professors. This work led to the development of an integrated working prototype system, which is now being used at the Russian and United States universities and institutes involved.

AB  - This paper presents a multipurpose fuzzy control support system. Fuzzy control is an intelligent control aimed to have an ultimate degree of autonomy in terms of reasoning and planning and to have the ability to extract the most valuable information from unstructured and noisy data. Conventional control versus intelligent control is discussed first in this paper. Then the theoretical background related to fuzzy logic and fuzzy control is given. Next, the proposed fuzzy control support system is introduced. This system includes an educational tutorial for fuzzy control, a design tool of a fuzzy controller, a simulation tool giving the total fuzzy controlled system evolution, a wizard that gathers all required information from user, and finally a possibility of fuzzy rule-base generation either from equivalence to a conventional three-term controller or from simulation. This rule-base generation feature helps to obtain an approximate rule-base that may be refined later on, according to the expected performance. The proposed support system is developed using Visual C++ and run under PC platform. The animated, interactive, and graphical windows interfacing facilitates the usage of this system. A simple fuzzy control system of two coupled tanks is handled as an illustrative example.

AB  - Presented are three of the seven most popular intelligent software techniques: fuzzy logic, machine learning (algorithm inspect) and neural networks. These intelligent software techniques have been motivated by a variety of disciplines such as neurology, statistics, computer science, psychology, organization theory. The field of artificial intelligence integrates these ideas from tlie underlying disciplines. The business world often seeks simple explanations as to how these technologies can be used in business efficiently and effectively. We have tried to reduce the complex models and adapt them for pragmatic business orientation in describing when and how to use these intelligent software techniques. Their power is extracted from databases, data warehouses, telecommunications networks and desktops. It is clear, the time of intelligent software support in business has arrived.

AB  - Researchers in game playing have developed a class of practical algorithms called alpha-beta pruning to improve the efficiency of search in two-player games. However, these efficient algorithms appear to be inadequate to capture all necessary information to play the game of Go at a level above that of an intermediate human player. This is due to the complexity and knowledge-based requirement of this game. In this paper, search and knowledge are both involved in solving one of the resource-demanding non-trivial artificial intelligence applications. Together, they constitute a basic skeleton of a program that is capable of playing a complete game of Go. This program is designed to reflect on the significance of adding knowledge heuristics in the form of pattern matching and book moves to the search technique offered by the traditional alpha-beta algorithm.

AB  - In the last decade, innovative trends in modern control and automation in conjunction with newly developed artificial intelligent tools lead the way to the emergence of the new discipline of intelligent control. As the word intelligence may imply, intelligent control systems are systems where control algorithms are developed by emulating certain characteristics of intelligent biological systems, such as autonomy, learning, and adaptation. This emerging area of control engineering is fueled by advancements in artificial intelligence hardware and software tools such expert systems (computers programs that emulates the actions of a human who is expert in his profession), neural networks (artificial hardware and/or software which emulates biological neural networks which are characterized by learning and adaptivity), fuzzy systems (rule-based systems which use fuzzy logic for knowledge representation and inference in uncertain environments), genetic algorithms (a computer-aided tool based on the survival of the fittest principle found in natural biological systems). As technology profounded, modern aircrafts became more sophisticated with increasing sensors, actuators, and computers. The current display panel of modern aircrafts employ enhanced decision-making capabilities and improved flying quality. The fundamental role of intelligent control in these modern aircrafts are in dispensing with many human-dependent actions, enhancing mission capabilities, improving flight performance, increasing reliability and safety, and lowering the cost and weight of the aircraft. In this paper, a detailed overview of the role of intelligent control in flight systems is presented. Furthermore, three key applications of intelligent aircraft control systems are presented.

AB  - The author gives an overview of intelligent and autonomous software, also called agents, from a technological viewpoint. In addition, he introduces several concrete agents that have been developed by NEC Corporation. Agent technology is divided into three layers: agent programming languages, agent platforms and applications. Each layer possesses particular technical keywords, for example, distributed object programming in the language layer, agent communication protocols and architecture in the platform layer, and agent collaboration models in the application layer. NEC Corporation has been conducting research and development in every layer in order to produce convenient and high-level intelligent software for our customers. Our agents play the role of an office secretary, an intelligent communication controller, a certain kind of project manager or a software robot for Web exploration.

AB  - A biomimetic artificial gravity-sensing organ (GSO) is being developed based on the neural cytoarchitectonics of its biological counterpart (BGSO) to investigate the development, structure and function of vertebrate gravity receptors in microgravity and in terrestrial environments. Increased understanding of the dynamical organization of the BGSO by reverse engineering hybrid approaches may yield contributions to gravitational biology, biomedicine, computational neuroscience and adaptive evolvable hardware.

AB  - Embedded advanced controls, diagnostics, and optimization make today's control systems seem to think for themselves. Today, most of the artificial intelligent (AI) software suppliers are teaming up with programmable logic controller, human machine interface, and distributed control system vendors to ensure easy transitions. There are several AI systems available in the market that will plug up to a plant with minimal effort. How to connect an AI system is no longer a major issue. For most plants, the only remaining question is which loops to try AI on first.

AB  - A novel method for artificial target recognition based on the wavelet transform and Holder constant was put forward by describing the average Holder constant of fractal Brownian motion and by analyzing the difference of relative depth between the target and its complex background. Besides, several examples for illustrating the application of the proposed method to artificial target recognition were also given, from which, it can be seen that the anti-interference capability in artificial target recognition do can be improved significantly by using the wavelet transform. More accurate localization can be attained by using two images in the same region by different scale, hence the method is suitable for identifying specific targets in a complex background.

AB  - The code-on-demand type of mobile code paradigm enables network systems to dynamically evolve their functionality. However, the demand loading nature degrades the responsiveness of the systems. In order to deal with this problem, we propose a new loading technique which is adapted from prefetching. The proposed technique can improve the responsiveness of the system by avoiding the accumulation of code propagation delay. We have evaluated the proposed mechanism in our management protocol gateway system. The result shows that the proposed method reduces the response time by approximately 50%.

AB  - This paper presents an agent communication platform named MIPLACE equipped with agent monitoring, tracing, security and registration functions in addition to the basic functions, such as movement, cooperation and so on. Interest in agent communication technology, which realizes a variety of communication services using agent oriented softwares, is raised as one of new distributed processing technologies corresponding to modern wide-area networks. Agent communication platforms which provide an agent development environment and an agent execution environment are announced from software vendors and communication service providers. In the technologies, studies of various techniques, such as process migration and security, are proposed. In this paper, we take notice of the facility for the agent software development and the management in order to provide the users and developers of agent software more useful agent communication platform besides the basic functions. In particular, MIPLACE provides sophisticated and effective GUI so that operators can use the functions easily and develop necessary communication services.

AB  - During the last years the Artificial Intelligence derived techniques have been applied to electrical power system. In particular the use of artificial neural networks in the control of electric energy generation and transmission is aninteresting research topic. A quick approximate solution of complex mathematical problems, like an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) previously trained off-line on a particular cases set, is a good alternative to the classical numerical algorithms in the solution of load-flow equations. In this paper the problem of load-flow in wide electrical power systems is faced; the solution strategy proposed uses Progressive Learning Networks (PLN) and a particular Grouping Genetic Algorithm (GGA), that involves statistical methods to formulate the problem.

AB  - Hypoxic tissue damage is a common consequence of various diseases of arterial, venous, or lymphatic etiology. One method that allows the noninvasive measurement of tissue oxygen partial pressure (TcpO2) is through the use of a transcutaneous oximeter (TO). The basic part of the TO is a Clark probe, which works on polarographic principle. It consists of two electrodes placed in an alkaline solution. The application of TO in TcpO2 measurement in angiology is discussed.

AB  - Mechatronics received close attention in October 1998, first at a day conference organized by the IEE looking at the Japanese experience, and then at a lecture on intelligent mechatronics. Japanese experience was looked at from the standpoint of Tom Salusbury, who had been Science and Technology Secretary at the British Embassy in Tokyo, and David Wilson, of Cambridge Consultants, who had been on two fact-finding visits. These were followed by two speakers, Stephen King and Rick Burbridge, who worked for subsidiaries of Japanese companies, and Ian Ross, whose company, KeyMed, is closely associated with Olympus in Japan. Intelligent mechatronics was reviewed by the new chairman of IEE's Control Division, Geoff Roberts.

AB  - AI methods are originally meant to solve problems too difficult for complex nonlinear, multivariable control systems. In other applications, including motion control, they perform auxiliary and supervisory functions. To add additional motion control applications, a new direction for AI methods promises performance comparable to other solutions, but offering faster, less costly implementation. A wider view of motion control reveals AI methods at work in anti-lock brakes and cruise controls of vehicle systems, and in anti-sway control of cranes.

AB  - Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) technology is an important component in reaching the next level of quality and maintaining the competitive edge in Electronic Assembly. However, to implement this technology in today's rapidly changing environment, AOI system suppliers must greatly simplify the programming process and significantly reduce the false call rate. A novel approach has been developed to address both of these problems using an Adaptive Knowledge Based System. This technique utilizes sophisticated automated reasoning techniques and requires no programming for new board setup, and through online learning can eliminate the reoccurrence of false alarms. This paper will briefly discuss the AOI techniques currently in use, including the Adaptive Knowledge Based System used in the AIMS. The paper then discusses the implications of the technologies for the two common tasks of new board setup and dispositioning false alarms in a production environment. The simple and accurate execution of these two tasks is essential to realize the full potential of AOI: greatly increasing quality and reducing the manual labor involved.

AB  - The proliferation of electronically controlled systems in cars and trucks has greatly complicated the task of diagnosing the source of malfunction. To address this issue, many companies have adopted a structured information environment based on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). SGML delivers accurate and up-to-date service information to the technician for diagnostics and troubleshooting. SGML can also be integrated with artificial intelligence, case-based reasoning, and model-based reasoning for more efficiency.

AB  - Disk defragmentation, sometimes called disk optimization, is a software-controlled operation that consolidates the scattered parts of files so that they are once again contiguous. A new development in disk defragmentation is intelligent file placement which increases performance by determining which files are most likely to be used and intelligently placing them on the disk where they can be accessed most quickly. Intelligent file placement technology is based on the premise that the most recently used files are most likely to be used again. This strategy enables a defragmenter using it to categorize files according to when they were last used.

AB  - The authors apply an improved technique based on fuzzy logic to fulfill the requirement to compute a fault hypothesis in a model-based diagnostic reasoner. The primary focus of the paper is to extend previous work and illustrate the use of the improved algorithm. The paper deals primarily with two types of uncertainty: test outcome uncertainty and inference uncertainty. The issue of conflict detection and conclusion rehabilitation is addressed. This proposed fuzzy logic approach uses the confidence parameters defined in the IEEE 1232: Artificial Intelligence Exchange and Service Tie to All Test Environments (AI-ESTATE) standard to provide a robust reasoning under uncertainty capability.

AB  - Green (1998) expresses dissatisfaction with contemporary connectionist models as theories of cognition. A reexamination of the historical distinction between hypothetical constructs and intervening variables and their relative roles in theory development reveals an important role for well-designed, parsimonious connectionist models in the study of cognition. Although realist theories (i.e., theories that include hypothetical constructs) are bolder and might provide more intellectual satisfaction to psychologists, instrumentalist theories (i.e., theories that include only intervening variables) can bring rigor and understanding to the enterprise of cognitive science.

AB  - One of the most challenging aspects to teaching manufacturing principles is instilling in the student a "systemic view" of the entire manufacturing process. Traditional manufacturing education has focused on studying the depth of a particular component of the manufacturing system, such as scheduling/MRP or production processes. This traditional approach often leaves to the student the task of synthesizing these different, but extremely related, bodies of knowledge into an integrated whole. The study of the way that decisions propagate among the different facets of manufacturing requires one to address the structure and content of the knowledge associated with each of them. This integration of manufacturing topics is not usually included in a manufacturing education. For three years a course entitled "Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing" has been taught at Oakland University. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field aimed at endowing computers with human-like cognitive capabilities including, learning, judgement, and perception. The course addresses the capture, representation, and use of manufacturing knowledge. The objectives of this course include: 1) Understand the decisions made in the manufacturing 2) Understand how to successfully apply world-class manufacturing principles. 3) Understand interrelationships between manufacturing decisions. 4) Create a "system level" intuition of the manufacturing discipline. In particular the course addresses the decision and interrelationship among decision in the process planning, shop-floor operations, scheduling, cost estimating, and quality assurance domains. The course even addresses the effects that product design in the manufacturing decision making process. The remainder of the paper describes the course and lessons-learned in trying to instill a "system level" understanding of the manufacturing process. The paper also describes a laboratory component of the course to add a practical, "hands-on" experience as a ground for the theoretical discussions of manufacturing knowledge.

AB  - The technique of study of meaning realization including the elements of phenomenological paradigm (Husserl) and experimental approach is proposed. The constructive means for the description of the processes of meanings' understanding through association of prepositions and particles with the dynamic picture exposed by computer are used. The understanding of the dynamic picture, as well the meaning of the word includes the analogous intentional acts. It was shown that new theory of meaning realization named the dynamic theory permits to reveal the dynamics and structure of meaning in contrast to contemporary linguistic (static) theories proposed the strategies of the word realization through the understanding another words. The results may be used for the foreign language teaching and in Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - Ws use Guarded Horn Clause (G.H.C.)as means to describe Pascal - like Languages. Then there arises a problem what semantics G.H.C. has.G.H.C. is a subset of Prolog. So you may think there is no problem. However G. H. C. has very simple controll structure compared to Prolog and it must be shown explicity. In this paper a property of G. H. C. is derived from the description of Prolog and then abstruct interpreter of G.H.C. is given.

AB  - The intelligent interface agents interpret data on the current user, the user's task, the user's environment and/or the system's hardware to manage display configurations. By creating a customized interface for each user, intelligent agents can provide information filtering to enhance an application's usability. In addition to automatically managing display options, an interface agent enables the application to be used to its full potential without requiring the user to have extensive knowledge of the system.

AB  - For the past four years, we have been examining how to make the WWW accessible for people with disabilities. This has involved gathering information through interviews, interactions with users having difficulty accessing the Web, creation and investigation of experimental Web pages and solicitation of feedback from demonstrations. The results show that the problem cannot be solved solely by modifications to Web pages. User agents (browsers), protocols (e.g., HTML) and assistive technologies need to change also. Regarding HTML pages, the results show the need to provide alternative forms of information and meta-information, elements to avoid, and the proper uses of HTML elements. In addition to making pages more accessible to people with disabilities, these measures also facilitate access by pocket browsers, indexing mechanisms, intelligent agents, and voice input/output access to the Web, as well as increasing the usability for all users.

AB  - Using Artificial Intelligence, an Expert-system computerized decision aid, DATA (Decision Aid for Therapy of Angina), was developed to run on a personal computer and to calculate the probability of each possible clinical event based on individual patient characteristics. Ten patients were evaluated retrospectively by DATA and by a group of cardiologists. DATA agreed with the primary therapy given to all patients. The physician group underestimated both the value of alternative therapies and changes for all therapies. This decision aid allows comparison of alternative therapies in terms of relative patient outcome and anticipated costs can be better estimated.

AB  - In this paper we propose a method in aligning Thai and English sentence by using surface feature of languages and bilingual dictionary. Thai has no sentence boundary and no space between words in a sentence which differs from English. This problem causes difficulty in alignment. Our method consists of 3 steps: 1) segmentation of Thai words and morphological analysis of English words 2) counting content words in order to roughly align the pairs of Thai and English sentence 3) correcting the misaligned pairs of sentences. The result of our algorithm is good.

AB  - Route flapping and incorrect routing information propagation are problems in Inter- AS routing today Detailed monitoring and analysis of multiple BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing logs is necessary to determie the sources of route flapping and incorrect routing. Current monitoring information however, does not contain sufficient detail and cannot be accessed efficiently. This paper introduces Distributed Internet Route Eye (DIRE), which is a distributed agent architechture for Inter-AS route monitoring. In this architecture, Monitor Agents record detailed BGP route information from BGP router, Operator Agents query multiple Monitoring Agents for specific information to efficiently determine the source and cause of the problems.

AB  - Present-day computers are merely fast adding machines whose usefulness is limited to routine clerical operations. However, the next 50 years will see electronic information processing systems brought to a stage of sophistication comparable to that of today's electronic communication systems. This will require two things: first, the basic principles of underlying the brains method of digesting information must be discovered and translated into simple electronic systems; and second, capacity for electronic storing and processing of information, on a scale equal to that of the human brain must be developed.

AB  - Fifty years from now, in 2048, with computer replacing motor, the growth and infusion of computers into every nook and cranny of personal and industrial life will be visible. Three technologies are driving the growing use of computers. First, the underlying component technology simultaneously is becoming less expensive and more capable. Second, communication infrastructure is undergoing a similar increase in capability and decrease in cost. Last, breakthroughs in computer science and mathematics, coupled with increases in raw computing speed, are providing solutions to problems previously thought to be intractable.

AB  - A network-attached storage server (NASS) constitutes a large storage pool shared by many clients, available to all as a network resource. It is the culmination of two concepts: the direct attachment of storage to the network, and the consolidation of storage resources in a powerful intelligent storage system. it lays the foundation for what is a fundamental departure from the computer centric-world, to a storage-centric architecture that puts data where it belongs, at the center of the computing environment. Through very high data accessibility, autonomy and direct connectivity, NASS helps break an important barrier, placing storage at the center of the computing environment.

AB  - In the development of the unattended and self-adjust machining system, where the human operator must be replaced by a Computer Numerical Control, the control system should properly process information with its varying environment in an intelligent way. The intelligent CNC must be able to recognize, in real time, major problems of operation connected to the machining process like chipping problems or tool breakage. To do that, the CNC intelligent system must be able to receive, process, and analyze inputs from multiple types of external sensor attached to it. This approach can only be possible on the base of an Open Architecture. The author of this paper proposes the use of fuzzy logic to develop an intelligent adaptive controller for manufacturing operations based on an open architecture that must be able to face problems of control, monitoring and fault diagnosis in real time.

AB  - During the last years, a lot of EEG research efforts was directed to intelligent methods for automatic analysis of data from multichannel EEG recordings. However, all the applications reported were focused on specific single tasks like detection of one specific "event" in the EEG signal: spikes, sleep spindles, epileptic seizures, K complexes, alpha or other rhythms or even artefacts. The aim of this paper is to present a complex system being able to perform a representation of the dynamic changes in frequency components of each EEG channel. This representation uses colours as a powerful means to show the only one frequency range chosen from the shortest epoch of signal able to be processed with the conventional "Short Time Fast Fourier Transform" (S.T.F.F.T.) method.

AB  - The most important contribution of the recent research in measurement was that the measuring equipment is involved in the information processing and that instruments are actually specialized computer systems. Design of the instruments is seemingly a straightforward task, however, complex measurement problems are ill-conditioned and knowledge-intensive. Considerable portion of the measurement related knowledge is in such problems heuristic and non-analytic in character. To evaluate it and to inject it into the measuring system design require symbolic approaches developed in artificial intelligence field. In consequence complex `intelligent' measuring systems are coupled numerical-symbolic hybrid systems, with the knowledge intensive (expert) component cooperating with extensive numerical libraries. Such systems can even be embedded in other architectures designed for more abstract goals.

AB  - The successful implementation of outcomes measurement is jeopardized by its application within systems that do not control inputs. This systemic flaw within health care can be corrected by placing critical knowledge that is now in the minds of individual practitioners into computer-based knowledge coupling tools that can (1) track and control the inputs to the system in a disciplined and routine manner and (2) process information without error or bias. Outcomes then become a natural by-product of what amounts to a paradigm shift in the conceptualization and implementation of health care. Â© 1998 Aspen Publishers, Inc.

AB  - A possibility of the development of radar object identification systems is considered in the direction being non-traditional for this field. This direction is based on the complex use of information sources of different physical origin and the application of the methods of pattern recognition theories and artificial intelligence systems. The adaptive algorithms can be developed not only on using Bayesian procedures but also on the basis of other mathematical theories.

AB  - Historically, the dynamic security contingency screening and ranking methods unlike their static security counter parts have not received a great deal of attention. With the recent progress in analytical techniques and major advancements in computer hardware, contingency screening for DSA seems to be more feasible and justified. So far, the only methods suggested for dynamic security CS&R are the analytical methods using the Transient Energy Function (TEF) and the the use of Artificial Intelligence including Expert Systems and Neural Networks. This paper reports on the findings of a recently completed Canadian Electric Association (CEA) funded project exploring the application of neural network to dynamic security contingency screening and ranking. The idea is to use the information on the prevailing operating condition and directly provide contingency screening and ranking using a trained neural network. To train the two neural networks for the large scale systems of B.C. Hydro and Hydro Quebec, in total 1691 detailed transient stability simulation were conducted, 1158 for B.C. Hydro system and 533 for the Hydro Quebec system. The simulation program was equipped with the Energy Margin Calculation Module (Second Kick) to measure the energy margin in each run. The first set of results showed poor performance for the neural networks in assessing the dynamic security. However, the following corrective measures improved the results significantly: â¢ A neural network with two outputs of energy margin and maximum swing angle performs marginally worse than two single-output neural networks, one with energy margin and maximum swing as their outputs. â¢ The quality of results for both outputs of energy margin and maximum swing can be reasonably accurate. However, unlike the energy margin, the maximum swing angle does not pro vide an accurate security index. â¢ The partitioning of the study systems to smaller subsystems of interest based on applied contingencies had a major impact on the accuracy of the results. This was justifiable since not all the features in one subsystem provide relevant information on the security status of another subsystem. â¢ The fine-tuning and intelligent selection of key features improved the accuracy significantly. â¢ Dynamic features improve the accuracy very marginally. Elimination of these features results in significant computational savings. â¢ Fine tuning of selected features and an increase in the ratio of number of training samples to the number of features enhance the accuracy of the results. This ratio for the final results reported here are around 10. The neural results obtained for the two systems of B.C. Hydro and Hydro Quebec show that with a reasonable degree of accuracy, the neural network was able to perform classification and ranking using the system margin of stability. These results demonstrate a good potential for neural network in dynamic security assessment contingency screening and ranking.

AB  - Analyzing construction project performance is a diagnostic process, and forecasting project performance is a cognitive process. Both processes require the exercise of expert judgment and intelligence. Artificial Intelligence programming techniques such as expert systems and neural networks provide assistance to construction project managing personnel in capturing the construction knowledge needed for analyzing and forecasting construction projects. This paper describes the development of a framework titled PAFEX (Performance Analysis and Forecasting Expert System). The framework has two main modules. The first module is a diagnostic expert system that has the objective of analyzing construction project performance and adopts causal diagnostic reasoning as a strategy, and object-oriented programming technology as a knowledge representation scheme. The second module has the objective of forecasting the construction performance and applies artificial neural networks as a modeling strategy. The advantages and limitations of these two modeling processes are discussed. Issues regarding integrating the proposed approach with existing project management systems are also discussed.

AB  - Modelling of multilevel decisionmaking with imprecision can be applied to many different areas. In this paper it is proposed as a support tool in the field of concurrent engineering for the problem of concurrency satisfaction. The underlying conceptual model belongs to the class of deduction graphs in graph theory for which a theoretical framework exists. Concurrency is satisfied by a design team and is influenced by various agents, such as manufacturing agent, marketing, economic, maintenance agent, etc. Concurrency set is a collection of attributes (manufacturability, serviceability, etc.) necessary to achieve concurrency. This paper discusses an approach to plan an optimal policy to expand concurrency sets in situations where some attributes can be defined by different levels of acceptance. The ideas presented are illustrated with examples.

AB  - When building a decision tree, we have to select the most important attribute among all attributes of instances, which form the training data set. ReliefF [4,5] is an advanced algorithm for feature selection, as it is not "near-sighted" and can be used in real-world domains (improves certainty of estimates, deals with noisy and missing data and solves multi-class problems). We extended ReliefF in such a way, that feature qualities for different number of near neighbours are calculated simultaneously (6). After testing over 20 standard domains (Table 1, Figures 2,3), it was found, that decision trees obtained with ReliefF algorithm [5] are approximately equaly successful as those built by ReliefFS algorithm, when comparing only classification accuracy on training instances. However, another characteristic is superior: the number of leaves in decision trees is reduced heavily in many cases. This happens especially in medical domains. Our tests included unpruned trees, trees pruned with MDL1+ method [8], and finally, trees pruned with m-probability estimate [1]. Decision trees were built with Assistant-R [4] and Assistant-RS, respectively. Extended algorithm ReliefFS is better than algorithm ReliefF. The above statement is confirmed also by testing results on an artificially composed (synthetic) domain PCMS.

AB  - Distributed control systems (DCSs) have been used to improve processes by making the most of available equipment. DCS vendors are now talking about taking this same concept to the next level, expending the systematic methods of control now commonly used for the process to the whole plant. Truly intelligent field devices must be available and integrated into the system. A few devices are becoming available that promise to deliver field information. For example, using what it calls intelligent motor technology, Reliance Electric/Rockwell Automation, Athens, Ga., has developed an instrumented motor.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted browsing combines knowledge-based systems with searching and browsing to find something for the first time, find changes in something, or refind something. AI-assisted browsing can be helpful in information overload and underload and it is a part of knowledge management. Generally, individuals and organizations organize AI-assisted browsing. Individuals have particular knowledge interests and generate individual views while at the organizations level, firms provide single/multiple promulgated views of knowledge. To facilitate search or refinding, some systems require users to establish markers indicating items of interest. In other settings, systems use the data generated from browsing to learn a user's interests.

AB  - Like many products, motors are becoming smarter and more flexible through the integration of computer technology. Such motors, for example, offer multiple set point speeds and are easily programmed to run at any one speed setting. And with each new hardware and software improvement, designers must rethink not only the role of motors, but also that of related motion components.

AB  - Artificially intelligent systems operate like the human mind to consolidate and communicate important information in a processing plant. Like the human brain, intelligent systems prioritize tasks and build conclusions based on previous experiences. This optimizes plant operations by freeing the operator to think at a higher level. Rather than trying to control all of the parameters, the operator can then concentrate on maximizing each process. The three types of artificially intelligent systems: the expert systems; neural networks; and the fuzzy logic systems, are discussed.

AB  - Discusses the reason behind the limited acceptance of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) beyond developmental roles: this is mainly because new innovation is technology rather than market driven. Oceaneering's targeted approach is to use unmanned vehicles for specific applications where they offer major advantages. The requirements for successful innovation are reviewed with reference to the offshore industry. Key issues are UUV capabilities, cost effectiveness and risk aversion, not technology. The application of these criteria are discussed in detail. Oceaneering's review of potential market opportunities is outlined. The company has selected the Odyssey vehicle as an attractive UUV solution. Its advantages include simplicity, commercial off-the-shelf equipment, reliability and ease of maintenance, and proven experience.
While a variety of unmanned underwater vehicles have been developed, very few have found successful application in the underwater industry beyond developmental roles as test platforms where 'technical sizzle' alone can be adequate justification to try a new innovation. In the case of UUVs, Oceaneering Technologies believes that there are several valid reasons for their limited acceptability, hence the company develops a targeted approach to use UUVs for specific application where they offer major advantages over other solutions. This innovative approach demonstrates three things: it can do the job, it is low risk, and it is a cost-effective solution.

AB  - The most important contribution of the recent research in measurement was that the measuring equipment is involved in the information processing and that instruments are actually specialized computer systems. Design of the instruments is seemingly a straight-forward task, however, complex measurement problems are ill-conditioned and knowledge-intensive. Considerable portion of the measurement related knowledge is in such problems heuristic and non-analytic in character. To evaluate it and to inject it into the measuring system design require symbolic approaches developed in artificial intelligence field. In con-sequence complex 'intelligent' measuring systems are coupled numerical-symbolic hybrid systems, with the knowledge intensive (expert) component cooperating with extensive numerical libraries. Such systems can even be embedded in other architectures designed for more abstract goals.

AB  - Case-based reasoning (CBR) is an AI-based technology that offers a novel problem-solving approach that relies on past situations. The basic cycle of CBR System is 'input a problem, find a relevant old situation, adapt it.' It is a rich and knowledge-intensive method that captures past experiences, enhances existing problem-solving methods, and improves the overall learning capabilities. It is also a paradigm that addresses issues of memory, learning, planning and problem-solving. It is therefore both a problem solving approach and a cognitive model of the way in which people learn and remember.

AB  - This paper describes a knowledge-based concurrent engineering approach to automate the activities of the product analysis process. The major focus in this paper is the development of the analysis model from the product specification data. The approach discussed in this paper recognizes the differences between product design and model design. The product specification (or computer-aided design) data can be used as the starting point to build performance models for analysis which, in turn, can be used to generate the appropriate mesh specification. The unconventional approach described in this paper proposes a way to help reduce the difficulty and tedium of the analysis model building and mesh specification tasks in the product analysis process. A description of an Al-based framework to perform the activities of analysis model formulation and mesh specification is provided. Implementation aspects related to analysis model formulation are also addressed. Â© 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A new robot control architecture is proposed which combines the functions of planning, intention switching, execution, plan validity and plan execution monitoring, and fault recovery. Emphasis is placed on providing a technological basis for building control systems for intelligent robots by modeling these functionalities using simple, though powerful, graph manipulation techniques and introducing different types of plan components for monitoring, planning, and execution using an object-oriented design approach. The proposed architecture is related to existing approaches and results obtained from the research areas of monitoring and planning. An implementation of the architecture is described with results from tests in a simulated environment being reported. A new method for grasp and motion planning based on hierarchical fuzzy logic rule sets is presented and its feasibility is verified by applying it to an industrial paper roll manipulator.

AB  - Barresi (1995) accurately distills the overall position on the mind defended in (Brigsjord, 1992), but his objection to this defense is based upon a non sequitur. Moreover, his proposed replacement for the Turing Test by the "Cyberiad Test," certainly intriguing, suffers from the same fatal flaw infecting Turing's original test: viz., it is entirely possible (maybe even probable) that the Cyberiad Test should be passed with flying colors by mere zombies.

AB  - This paper reports the development of an Al-based approach for integration and collaboration of diverse expertise in fixture design and analysis. The preliminary work that proposes a co-operative fixture design system in order to achieve the automation of fixture design process, is described in the paper. A blackboard based framework, capable of integrating diverse knowledge sources, is used as the problem-solving model to realize such a system. A working prototype along with its implementation strategies is illustrated to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed system.

AB  - It is difficult to predict the future rate of prison population growth, given that major policy changes are being contemplated. Artificial intelligence software can provide correctional planners with useful information. However, forecasting is an information tool that should not be misused as an excuse to drive decisions and legislation. Prisons should focus less on innovation and more on implementation. The central problem lies in the failure to commit to the long-term implementation of programs. Corrections has a political need to show that programs work, and achieving this goal requires increased accountability in the form of routine data collection, relevant outcome measures and evaluation criteria, and performance-based objectives. Prison systems in the future may find themselves with new responsibilities, such as Total Quality Management, among correctional management and offenders, as well as enhanced aftercare services with an emphasis on employment placement and retention of offenders.

AB  - The present paper describes a computer program that is an implementation of a new algorithm for discovering mathematical models for financial time series prediction, combining Artificial Intelligence methodology with Dynamical Systems Theory, Fractal Theory and Statistical Methods. Given a financial time series for a specific problem, the computer program develops mathematical models based on the geometry of the data, using three different approaches: Dynamical Systems, Fractals and Statistics. The program then analyzes all of the mathematical models obtained before to make a selection of the model that will give us the best prediction for the financial time series. The selection is done by the program using a combination of heuristics and calculations that are contained in the knowledge base.

AB  - The current trend in computing is to introduce more formality into the field. These trends, which may be catalogued as physicalist, will probably introduce substantial progress in this field. This paper presents a structural model for organized systems with multithreaded hierarchies. The formalization introduced by the Theory of general systems is chosen as the starting point. The concept of organized system with multithreaded hierarchies is then unfolded using the structured hypergraph taking agents, effects and interactions as primitive elements. This formalization would lead to a better control and greater capacity for expression in the design process. Furthermore, as expected in every physicalist trend, there is a potential for increasing design capacity and widening the field of computing.

AB  - Hybrid architectures for intelligent systems is as a new direction in the artificial intelligence research which aims at the development of the next generation of intelligent systems. Current research interests in this field focus on integrating neural networks and fuzzy logic to better exploit their strengths as well as expand their application domain. This paper presents a hybrid neuro-fuzzy system (HNFS) for the classification of Normal, Fusion and PVC cardiac beats of patient 208 in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The HFNS has a hierarchical topology consisting of three kinds of building blocks - fuzzy neural networks (FNNs), neural networks (NN) and fuzzy systems (FS). The FNNs and NNs are based on the feedforward backpropagation model. The FS is based on classical methods that measure the QRS area, height and RR interval. The first level of the HFNS accomplishes the task of classification of QRS complexes from leads MLII and VI into different classes. In case of the classification output being ambiguous, the QRS pattern is passed to the second HFNS level for final decision-making. A small inference system is developed to support the decision when the classification obtained from MLII and VI differs. Different configurations of FNNs, NNs and FS for both the first and the second level have been examined and tested. Classification results based on sensitivity and predictivity rates are presented and compared to previous approaches.

AB  - The WER-1000 plants under construction at Temelin (Czech Republic) were designed with an automatic reactor trip system triggered on seismic peak accelerations. Within the plant I&C upgrade, Westinghouse designed a digital Seismic Monitoring System to be integrated in an Artificial Intelligence based Diagnostic and Monitoring System. The system meets the requirements of the emerging standards prepared by the US NRC on the basis of EPRI studies, which recommend a detailed data evaluation and a pre-shutdown plant inspection before orderly shutdown, if required, rather than immediate emergency shutdown. The paper presents the arguments about automatic trip, as discussed in an IAEA meeting attended by expert consultants from Japan, Russia, USA and Eastern and Western Europe. It describes the system installed at Temelin, including the plant specific criteria for OBE exceedance. Finally it presents the capabilities and limitations of the integration into an overall Diagnostic and Monitoring System.

AB  - Real time applications like robotics require greater computational capabilities with each control strategy refinement. There appears to be a two major forces pushing real-time systems into the next generation: the need for artificial intelligence capabilities and the rapid advance in hardware. For real-time applications, reduced instruction set computing (RISC) systems used to have higher cost compared to complex instruction set computing (CISC). However, due to mass production of RISC microprocessor chips, cost have dropped and more powerful RISC-based microprocessor chips are now to be released. The basic features of the RISC architecture are discussed.

AB  - A pattern match reduction technique is presented for use in a system which integrates relational DBMS technology and AI production system technology. Production systems in general provide only rudimentary data storage and access capabilities. The integration of a DBMS with a production system would provide the production system access to the sophisticated data storage and retrieval capabilities of a DBMS and, at the same time, allow the application of production system inferencing capabilities to existing conventional databases. In an integrated system the left hand side of production rules can be represented as a relational query. The technique presented here maintains state information across production system cycles by storing and updating derived relations representing partial matches at internal nodes in the query tree.

AB  - In view of the considerable abuse to which the prefix `cyber' is being subjected in the commercial world, it is necessary to start this paper by indicating why the cybernetical movement in science arose in the first place, and what its mission is. This is a propitious moment to do so, for 1994 marked the birth centenary of Norbert Wiener, the father of cybernetics.

AB  - For many manufacturing processes, a vast amount of scientific knowledge is available. Often this knowledge is in the form of a numerical model. Due to time constraints, the use of such knowledge to make real-time control decisions during manufacturing processes is hampered. The present research investigation explores and demonstrates a method of extending such scientific knowledge to manufacturing processes, utilizing a form of artificial intelligence known as a neural network. Two neural network-based intelligent controllers for the autoclave cure process are developed, tested, and compared. The controllers use neural networks as predictive tools to "guide" the process toward desired, temporal product quality attributes. Both control strategies are implemented for control of simulations of the autoclave cure process. In effect, the combination of a controller and a simulation allows off-line control of the autoclave cure process through the prediction of proper cure cycles.

AB  - Research on Artificial Intelligence Systems for Nuclear Installations has been performed in cooperation with five research institutes (Ship Research Institute, Electrotechnical Laboratory, Japan Atomic Energy Research Instiute, Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research) , from 1989 to 1994 as the Cross-over Research Group with the support of the Science and Technology Agency. Ship Research Institute has been carrying out the research on the Man-Machine Interface (MMI) system for autonomous nuclear power plants. An autonomous nuclear power plant system, which will be realized in the next century, utilizes advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and robotics to increase safety, reliability and efficiency in nuclear plant operations. For the autonomous plant, operators are mainly engaged in the high levels of diagnosis and decision-making in emergencies. A MMI system requires an advanced function compared with that of the present nuclear power plants. This paper describes the concept of autonomous nuclear power plants, a plant simulator of an autonomous nuclear power plant, a contracted function model of a plant state, three-dimensional color graphic display of a plant state, and a function of automatic classification of plant states by the COBWEB method. A plant simulator has been developed by using the expert system G2 (Gensym Co.). The simulator generates plant process data (temperature, pressure, flow rate, and so on) at each component of a plant. This simulator models a pressurized water reactor and some examples of autonomous functions are incorporated. A contracted function model of a plant state has been produced at the main part of the MMI system based on plant process data from the simulator. Important information is efficiently shown to operators based on this plant model. The main purpose of the present study is to give the MMI system a function to identify the plant operational state, to update and revise the function model by itself, and to expand a knowledge about the possible states of a nuclear plant. In the three-dimensional color graphic display system, a plant state is expressed in a three-dimensional graphic display which receives sensor values from the plant simulator and expresses the plant state in nearly real time speed. A research on the automatic classification of plant states has been also performed, which shows us the relations among different plant states. The study is being continued to the 2nd stage Cross-over Research from 1994, as the Study on Divers, Cooperative Intelligent System for Autonomous Plants.

AB  - In this paper, we present a design of the software agent that is capable of dealing with situation-dependent tasks. A task is situation-dependent if the agent should determine appropriate actions to deal with it depending on situations. The proposed agent is constructed based on the layered architecture and behaves in an intention-driven manner. We have implemented a prototype of the agent and confirmed the effectiveness of our approach through an experiment.

AB  - For the integration of work on multi-agent systems, we propose a communication model of multi-agent systems which unifies CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)-based formulation of the agents' communication and a first-order logical formalization based on meta logics. This model captures various concepts of multi-agent systems: the concepts of the agents' environment such as time, actions, conditional and causality, the concepts of mental attitudes such as knowledge, plans, goals and intentions, and the concepts of agents' interaction such as speech acts, negotiations and collaboration. In this paper, modal logical formulas of those concepts are rebuilt into a first-order theory with three layers, as an executable specification for a proof system on first-order logic. This first-order theory can be taken as a agent oriented programming language which gives a general framework for integration of agent theories as specifications, agent architectures as problem solving systems, and agent languages for programming.

AB  - This article describes an interactive software called AIRS TM (for Artificial Intelligence for Reservoir Simulators). This system helps the user build the input data file for reservoir numerical simulation software. It uses Artificial Intelligence methods to create some 'friendly intelligent interfaces' used to input the large amount of data needed by the simulator 1. In these interfaces, the user is guided through a set of screens automatically generated by a screen generator 2 according to his set of data. Two operational applications were developed : 1) one for a well-testing simulator 3, 2) the other for a 3-phase, n-components compositional thermal reservoir model 4,5.

AB  - Developing a link between the experience and problem-solving ability of a user and the algorithm-specific parameters required by a program is a challenge facing all developers of scientific software applications. This paper presents the Gridding Advisor, a knowledge-based user interface designed to act as a link between geoscientists and surface modelling algorithms. Geoscientists often use computer-generated grids to store surface models and to produce contour maps representing the original data. Programs that build grids from irregularly-spaced well or seismic data estimate a surface value at each grid node using nearby data and a user-specified gridding algorithm. Many gridding algorithms are available, each using a different mathematical formula to estimate grid node values. Each algorithm may accept many user-specified parameters for control of the gridded surface shape. The expert user has learned to choose an approach to gridding based on the task at hand. This approach may comprise several steps such as grid construction, filtering the grid, and altering the grid node spacing. At each step, he selects an algorithm and parameters based on such high level concepts as gridding goals, data type and distribution, and geologic model. Geoscientists understand these concepts, but gridding software does not. Historically, to effectively use computer mapping software the geoscientist either had to learn the language of the software's algorithms and parameters, or hire technicians to master the software for him. The Gridding Advisor communicates with the geoscientist using high level surface modelling concepts. Using information the user volunteers about goals, data, and model, the Advisor recommends approaches to the gridding problem, composed of procedures, algorithms and key parameters. The expertise embodied in the Advisor consists of a conglomeration of rules of thumb, accumulated over years but never exhaustively documented or tested. A dual knowledge acquisition approach was taken, in which explicit domain knowledge available from text sources and direct questioning of experts was augmented with implicit knowledge discovered by observation of several experts solving many surface modelling cases.

AB  - Computer-assisted approaches to well log correlation are of interest to engineers and geologists for two reasons. In large field studies, a computer can be used simply to reduce the time required to correlate zones of interest. It is also possible that computer-assisted correlations may suggest zonal matches of interest and originality that might not have been considered. This paper presents a new approach to the computer-assisted log correlation. Geologic horizons are correlated between wells by use of an artificial intelligence rule-based technique. Using the symbol-manipulation capabilities of a computer language called List Processing (LISP), we developed a prototype rule-based system that (1) has symbolic representation of log data, (2) recognizes log shapes from traces, (3) identifies geologic zones from a sequence of shapes in a log, (4) characterizes the zones, (5) correlates zones from well to well with a set of "if/then" type of rules, and (6) uses a forward-chaining inference scheme to execute the rule base. The purpose of this paper is to describe the use of the LISP language and the methodology involved in the development of this system.

AB  - Architecture continues to be tempted to narrow down its area of concern to that which it can manage with available techniques (Elstob, 1976); avoiding those problems which seem too intractable and ignoring the Objects' it needs to appreciate if it is to succeed. Hence if we are not to invite the same criticism from the 21st century, as we ourselves made about the 19th then we should spend more time working on a general method for solving problems (Gerardin, 1968); developing coordinated approaches to a common purpose architecture. The imperative for 'domain specific knowledge' (to inform the future competence of computer programmes) is underpinned by research findings in artificial intelligence (Lenat and Feigenbaum, 1991): thus launching the quest for a method of knowledge fusion - of which an initial paradigm (for architectural design) is presented.

AB  - The study is dedicated to the possibility of utilizing picture processing algorithm. The task is to fix a sampling point and an amount to be sampled. The procedure is based on color information about scraps, that is achieved from a picture on the TV screen instead of that formed on receptors of human's eye. That is the principle for design of the scraps sampling robot system that would be built with the help of artificial intelligence technology. The results of experiments have confirmed the applicability of this system. To build a commercially viable system, however, efforts should be made to develop a more sophisticated processing algorithm as well as to make a full study based on pictures taken in the actual environment.

AB  - The main concepts of the theories with equality and the term rewriting systems (TRS) are considered. A neural network recommended as a means of speeding up the theorem proving system for the group theory is given. This network is used as an adviser about the order of the application of term rewriting rules of the complete TRS in the term reduction process. In particular, for every term, The network must recommend the choice of that rule at every reduction step, which would allow attempts to minimize both the number of rules application and reduction step number necessary for achievement of the normal form. In the testing process in using the suitable term encoding, the network allowed to reduce the rules application attempts, on average, by 30% in comparison with the traditional methods.

AB  - An approach to the design of the linguistic processor of an expert system of the building design is considered. Linguistic processor orientation to no analysis of a natural-linguistic text generally, but to forming an information-logical model of the expert system, along with allowance for specific features of the object region, allows to strictly formalize all the stages of processing the expert system task text. Predicates calculus and relation algebra are used as formalisms of the representation and processing linguistic objects.

AB  - The early 1980s was a time of major change for telecommunications in the K. Imminent were the privatization of computer networks which are expected to hasten the next industrial revolution. Thinking machines and artificial intelligence were widely expected to be the building blocks of a new society. Since that time, BT Laboratories focused on speech recognition. As a result, there has been unprecedented growth in the applications of voice based services.

AB  - As machine tools continue to get smarter, the shop of the future will be equipped with machines that not only load and unload parts, tools, and programs on their own, but also evaluate their own performance in real time and correct problems on the fly before the problems lead to scrapped parts. These ultra-modern shops will still need EDMs to cut hard materials and complicated shapes. These EDMs in turn will also have automated functions. Researchers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Nontraditional Manufacturing Research Center are currently working on these advanced EDMs.

AB  - An algorithm for constructing the logic inference has been proposed. It has been based on a formal grammar simulation of the resolution method for propositional calculus. The algorithm has provided for a preliminary analysis of the hypothesis set. An effective method of verifying the unsatisfiability of Horn clause sets has been described. It has allowed to construct logic inferences without sorting of deadlock variants. The considered algorithm has been realized on Turbo Pascal language and tested by a series of examples.

AB  - Online searching is more of an art than a science, notwithstanding the artificial intelligence software 'agents'. This means the absence of cut-and-dried formulas or easy solutions for the problems encountered. Presented are seven hands-on steps to follow when someone gets stuck. These steps are outlined roughly as: asking a co-worker's help, consulting the company's reference librarian, calling the help line, calling the information provider (IP), checking the service's or IP's WWW home page, searching Internet newsgroups and online SIGs, and hiring an expert.

AB  - In its bid to address the diversified needs of three-dimensional concept modelers, Stratasys Corp. released three new rapid prototyping products. For quick iterations of concepts early in the design cycle and easier communication among the members of product-development teams, Genisys was developed, which produces reasonably accurate 'check models' or 'rough drafts' designers can pass around. For greater precision and wider flexibility in materials and build styles, FDM 1650 is offered, which runs three times as fast as the company's current FDM (fused deposition modeling) machines. For fast fabrication of large precision prototypes (in several materials) that can serve as casting patterns and production masters, the Stratasys 8000 is being developed. It features an improved controller, perhaps a new x-y table, and software enhanced with artificial intelligence capabilities.

AB  - A new control system alternating both hybrid and intelligent control techniques is presented. The hybrid model looks upon a continuous model as a discrete-time equations model (resulted from discretization), a discrete event model as a Boolean differential system, and upon a knowledge-based model. A hybrid algorithm for simulation and control of system is developed, and the tools for hybrid simulation and Knowledge-Based Controller (KBC), comprises a knowledge acquisition system, an expert knowledge base, an inference engine, and an user interface. An application based on the simulation and control of a large scale and complex hydrological system, composed of 10 great lakes interconnected by a net-work of canals and channels is referred. This application is implemented on a PC 486 DX, using such languages as Mathcad 4.0 under Windows, and Turbo Prolog. Some concluding remarks reveal the novelty of the paper.

AB  - Time and space are two basic ontologies of representation of the physical world. This paper addresses an engineering perspective on how to reason about temporally and spatially qualified information. Two systems of calculi are proposed, one for temporal reasoning and the other for spatial reasoning. A segment is defined mathematically as a half-open real interval so that it can either be represented as a pair of quantitative endpoints, or determined by referring to other segments. The segment calculus defines operations to compute new segments from existing segments using quantitative endpoints or qualitative order relations. On the other hand, a region is a two-dimensional rectangular space modeled by its two orthogonal sides (segments) or by its spatial relations to other regions. The region calculus provides methods for handling regions based on their quantitative information or their qualitative relations. The utility and validity of the two calculi are proven through their applications to two mechanical engineering problems, one involving product processing scheduling and the other involving qualitative kinematic simulation.

AB  - An application domain is defined to be a collection of systems that share common characteristics. A domain model is used to capture common characteristics and variations among a family of software systems in a given application domain. From the domain model, target systems can be generated by tailoring the domain model according to the requirements of each target system. Thus, a knowledge engineer can develop the specifications for a target system in terms of the previously specified domain model, and does not have to perform a full systems analysis every time a new target system has to be constructed. This paper presents the design and application of an intelligent, microcomputer-based group support system used to automate the execution of collaborative organizational processes performed by multiple organizational members. Knowledge-based system technology has been used to construct the domain model of organizational processes and to generate a specific organizational process model from it. The intelligence of the system is demonstrated primarily by the following. First, intelligent software agents, each representing and emulating a human organization member, are used as the basis for the solution design. Second, as a part of the software solution, a knowledge-based requirements elicitation tool (KBRET) has been developed to automate the process of generating the specification for target systems from the domain model. The entire software solution has been implemented using CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System), an expert system shell developed at NASA/Johnson Space Center.

AB  - This paper describes the use of adaptive modeling tools for continuous process improvement in electronic equipment manufacture. The EMPF's system was written in CLIPS (C Language Implementation of a Production System) and Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language). CLIPS is a tool developed by NASA for handling a variety of knowledge representations with support for rule-based, object-oriented and procedural programming techniques. Rule-based programming allows knowledge to be represented as heuristics, which specify a set of actions to be performed for a given situation. Object-oriented programming allows complex systems to be modeled as modular components (which can be easily reused to model other systems or to create new components). The procedural programming capabilities provided by CLIPS are similar to those found in languages such as C.

AB  - The emergence of cooperation in a society of autonomous agents is investigated. Each agent is made to repetitively engage in a deal equivalent to the 'Prisoner's Dilemma' game, each time changing the other party of the deal. The conditions of the deal are that the contract histories of all the agents are disclosed to the public. Several deal strategies are evaluated, and their behaviors are investigated by matching them under various conditions. Next the social evolution of deal strategies is investigated using genetic algorithm techniques. Each agent bears a child according to the profit he gets through the deal. The child inherits the deal strategy of the parent, but the random mutation is introduced to the inheritance of strategies. It is shown that the robust and cooperative strategies emerge through the evolution starting from a simple 'Tit for Tat' algorithm.

AB  - An important step in converting a design concept into a manufactured product is process planning. In this step, a complete package of information on how to perform the manufacturing process is created, which may include work instructions for the shop floor, a bill of material, a quality control plan, and tool planning among others. The introduction of computers into manufacturing has certainly made the planning function more efficient. Moreover, with the comparative capabilities brought about by computer-aided process planning (CAPP), it becomes easier to find which plan best uses the facility's capabilities, which can be used for estimating future work, which is best for scheduling, and which plan reflects the best practice based on past experience. Some of the factors that must considered when using CAPP are presented and discussed.

AB  - A logic-algebraic approach to modeling object behaviour on the basis of the theory of qualitative reasonings (methods of â³naiveâ³ physics) is suggested. Qualitative algebra is defined, its properties are studied, and calculus is constructed for formalization of the qualitative inference. An example of the development of a qualitative model of the synchronous electric motor operating in the regime of voltage stabilization is given.

AB  - SNMP, the current de facto standard for network monitoring and control, is an outgrowth of the simple gateway management protocol (SGMP), a practical response to the proliferation of transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP). The development of SNMPv2 is later driven by the limitations of the original SNMP. SNMPv2 resolves major concerns with the inherent manager-slave structure, as well as the continual polling of SNMP; moreover, it speeds up performance by sending information to the console in bulk, rather than in small pieces from hubs, routers, and other managed devices. With its added security features, ease of bulk operations, and the promise of end-to-end management, this new version has rightfully earned respect of enterprise managers.

AB  - The personal computing world is currently migrating from relatively slow, asynchronous ISA-based system to a faster, burst-oriented synchronous PCI bus design. CardBus, the close cousin of the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus, is at the center of this architectural evolution in the portable PC segment. In this transition, a number of implementation decisions are being considered so as to provide a smooth upgrade path for supporting legacy devices.

AB  - Optimization systems are computer programs which analyze data according to specified rules and mathematical models to provide decision makers with recommended solutions or courses of action. With the help of an optimization system, managers of all kinds of truck fleets can begin on the high ground at the decision point, and dive down for more information as desired. In the trucking industry, optimization systems are being used to pair drivers and equipment with loads, create line-haul plans, reduced deadhead miles, improve customer service, maximize equipment utilization, reduce operating costs and even get drivers home more often.

AB  - Dependence of the generalized index of functional significance of radioelectronic apparatus on its complexity, energy consumption, mass, reliability and cost is analyzed. Ways of miniaturization problem solution in radioelectronics are shown. Expected prospects in solution of this problems are analyzed. The problem of displacement of 109 transistors on single crystal with the topological sizes 0.2-0.3 Î¼m is expected to be solved in the nearest decade. Microprocessors at the beat frequencies 500-2000 MHz will be designed in the future. Substantial attention is paid to systolic structures and processor matrices on super large integrated circuits as well miniaturization on the basis of transition from the planar integrated circuits to the three- dimensional ones.

AB  - Recently, Huberman and Hogg [in The Ecology of Computation, edited by B. A. Huberman (North-Holland, 1988), pp. 77-115] analyzed the dynamics of resource allocation in a model of computational ecosystems which incorporated many of the features endemic to large distributed processing systems, including distributed control, asynchrony, resource contention, and cooperation among agents and the concomitant problems of incomplete knowledge and delayed information. In this paper we supplement an analysis of several simple examples of computational ecosystems with computer simulations to gain insight into the effects of time delays, cooperation, multiple resources, inhomogeneity, etc. The simulations verify Huberman and Hogg's prediction of persistent oscillations and chaos, and confirm the Ceccatto-Huberman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 3143 (1989)] prediction of extremely long-lived metastable states in computational ecosystems. Extending the analysis to inhomogeneous systems, we show that they can be more stable than homogeneous systems because agents with different computational needs settle into different strategic niches, and that overly clever local decision-making algorithms can induce chaotic behavior.

AB  - Today, electronics are enabling engines to perform at increasingly higher levels of efficiency. Major enhancements are easier done by programming the electronics, rather than re-tooling every minor or major revision. These developments are in particular evident at the Cummins Engine Company with its 1995 CELECT Plus and ESP Plus engines. The advantages of these engines over the earlier engines include driveability and fuel economy.

AB  - Engineers are evaluating a digital data recording system known as the Portable Engine Analyzer Test Set (PEATS), which is used to detect and diagnose faults in helicopter turbine engines. PEATS allows electronic data recording and transfer of accurate performance information into a PC, where artificial intelligence (AI) methods are used to form and interpret the data. The information enables the determination of a gas turbine engine's internal condition. This knowledge, in turn, allows maintenance personnel to detect, identify and repair equipment deficiencies which may not otherwise be found using current maintenance practices.

AB  - The goal of stored knowledge is to solve or prevent problems without resorting to trial-and-error processes. The easiest information format to use is a flow chart with a series of ranked questions, with branches pointing to potential causes of the identified problem. It is helpful to have defect codes for statistical process control data collection. Training of inspection personnel will be more challenging, but the result will be a more efficient implementation of corrective action.

AB  - To keep the lights on for its customers during the mainline faults, Long Island Lighting Co. (Lilco) has launched an advanced distribution automation project based on actual voltage and current values, and breaker status and switch positions. It is a â³smartâ³ autosectionalizing and autorestoration system that automatically isolates fault locations on a main circuits and restores service to customers along unfaulted sections of the line. Lilco estimates the new system will reduce significantly the number of customers out of service.

AB  - Troubleshooting means locating and eliminating the source of trouble, a definition which closely captures the essence of statistical process control (SPC). SPC programs focus more on understanding and prevention than reworking. Using SPC as a troubleshooting tool entails looking for variation and its patterns. A detailed knowledge of the manufacturing process and its effect on all of the input materials and components is necessary to achieve efficient troubleshooting.

AB  - Robotic spacecraft are controlled by onboard sets of commands called âsequences.â Determining that sequences will have the desired effect on the spacecraft can be expensive in terms of both labor and computer coding time, with different particular costs for different types of spacecraft. Specification languages and appropriate user interface to the languages can be used to make the most effective use of engineering validation time. This paper describes one specification and verification environment (âSAVEâ) designed for validating that command sequences have not violated any flight rules. This SAVE system was subsequently adapted for flight use on the TOPEX/Poseidon spacecraft. The relationship of this work to rule-based artificial intelligence and to other specification techniques is discussed, as well as the issues that arise in the transfer of technology from a research prototype to a full flight system.

AB  - Avionics and health management technologies increase the safety and reliability while decreasing the overall cost for Earth-to-orbit (ETO) propulsion systems. New ETO propulsion systems will depend on highly reliable fault tolerant flight avionics, advanced sensing systems and artificial intelligence aided software to ensure critical control, safety and maintenance requirements are met in a cost effective manner. Propulsion avionics consist of the engine controller, actuators, sensors, software and ground support elements. In addition to control and safety functions, these elements perform system monitoring for health management. Health management is enhanced by advanced sensing systems and algorithms which provide automated fault detection and enable adaptive control and/or maintenance approaches. Aerojet is developing advanced fault tolerant rocket engine controllers which provide very high levels of reliability. Smart sensors and software systems which significantly enhance fault coverage and enable automated operations are also under development. Smart sensing systems, such as flight capable plume spectrometers, have reached maturity in ground-based applications and are suitable for bridging to flight. Software to detect failed sensors has reached similar maturity. This paper will discuss fault detection and isolation for advanced rocket engine controllers as well as examples of advanced sensing systems and software which significantly improve component failure detection for engine system safety and health management.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to simulate the motion of the lower extremity of a human being, a biped mechanism, walking along a straight path and to suggest a control strategy for minimizing the deviation from the linear path. A "gait" function is defined as a control that ensures that the biped walks along a straight path. By varying some parameters associated with the "gait" functions, which is chosen in such a manner as to simulate the motion of one member of the biped relative to an adjoining member, the most suitable combinations of such parameters for the specified geometry is subsequently determined. The study contributes to a better understanding in the design of robots, humanoids, and other artificial intelligence (A.I.) systems. Â© 1995.

AB  - With the advanced spread of Expert Systems (ES) more and more emphasis has been put on efficient knowledge representation. Constraints, a fast developing field in Artificial Intelligence (AI), try to cope with the new requirements imposed on the knowledge representation tools in practical applications. Efficient algorithms operating on constraint networks have been developed [4, 7, 10], and recently some constraint systems have been constructed [3], which are capable of solving relatively complicated problems stated in a declarative way. However, these systems put emphasis mainly on finding a feasible solution, they do not rank the different solutions. In some cases this will not suffice. When optimum criteria is meaningful to define, an optimal solution can be of importance. The present paper gives a brief overview of constraints, emphasizes the importance of searching for an optimal solution; and gives an application area where the optimal solution would highly improve the performance of the embedding system.

AB  - PRETRIEVE is a belief-network-based, unsolicited information-retrieval system that performs machine learning based on user feedback. We report here on the document-ordering and document-retrieval performance of PRETRIEVE. We developed a test collection of 410 judgments of document utility in a simulated medical order-entry context. We characterized the validity of these judgments, which were elicited from domain experts, by measuring interrater and intrarater reproducibility. We developed a measure of the quality of document orderings similar to the ROC-curve analysis used to evaluate document-retrieval systems. We found that the ordering performance of the PRETRIEVE system was (1) substantially better than random, (2) somewhat less than ideal, and (3) superior to that of versions of the PRETRIEVE system that used relevance feedback instead of utility feedback. Under a set of assumptions, which we make explicit, we found that the documents retrieved by a version of PRETRIEVE that modeled time cost were of higher utility than those retrieved by a similar rule-based system.

AB  - A growing concern about the shrinking size of the U.S. Navy budget and the pool from which selections will be made to âmanâ U. S. Navy shipboard systems has led to investigations on achieving improvements in affordability and operational effectiveness. One such investigation has resulted in the development of the Standard Monitoring and Control System (SMCS), a modular, open architecture control system which includes the control system components for propulsion, electric plant, auxiliaries, and damage control. The first major technology upgrade to SMCS will entail the insertion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies into HM&E monitoring and control applications. The Intelligent Machinery Control Integration Task (IMCI) was established to provide a structural approach for this major technology upgrade. As part of the first phase of IMCI, an identification of intelligent control requirements, an assessment of AI technologies, and a survey of intelligent control applications were performed. This paper lists those HM&Eârelated shipboard operational requirements from which intelligent machinery control requirements will be identified. Also, there is an initial assessment of AIârelated reasoning and the following AI technologies, knowledgeâbased systems, fuzzy logic, neural nets, and genetic algorithms. The survey provided some insight into applying AI technologies to SMCS shipboard operational requirements. Â© 1995 by the American Society of Naval Engineers

AB  - The two principal components of the future 'really intelligent network' (RIN) are information networking and self-organization. The first gives a platform for revenue generation by rapid delivery of information services demanded by users. The second decreases operating expenses to provide network management automation by embedding simple rules into network elements. In this article, key issues concerning RIN are considered, particularly with regard to information network of the future, impact of migrating intelligence to the network periphery, network management in the future, and the evolution of RIN.

AB  - Virtually all real-time operating systems development currently focuses on the lowest of the three traditional control levels. The problem is that sheer economics demands higher level real-time operating systems. Meeting this demand requires a major change in mindset. But in many real-time systems increasing processor speed is irrelevant. Time constraint-based management of communication devices can the limiting performance factor.

AB  - The paper presents an overview of the possibilities of artificial intelligence in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis applied to compression refrigeration plants. The general principles of a fault diagnosis system are outlined and various techniques of generating reference values are noted. Techniques for diagnosing deviations include the use of neural networks, fuzzy logic, etc. Criteria for assessing diagnostic systems are listed. A prototype diagnostic system is described. It includes a reference generator and a diagnosis strategy and is implemented as an independent module. The system was tested on a simple compression refrigeration system. (P. Cooke)

AB  - A novel approach to modeling properties of neurons is presented using the AI technique 'Qualitative Reasoning'. This paper introduces a Qualitative Reasoning Neuron, QRN, to model neural behavior. QRN is computationally less expensive than differential equation models of neuroscience and does not generalize details of a neuron as does artificial neural networks. Specifically, QRN approximates the voltage and current response predicted by the Hodgkin-Huxley squid axon model. The model simulates axon membrane features such as all or none action potentials, refractory periods and temporal summation of inputs. QRN's design facilitates modeling different cell properties and architectures.

AB  - A general purpose intelligence extraction system for multichannel one-dimensional time domain signals which are ubiquitous sources of information across many areas of science and technology is very much needed. It is essential that such a device not require low-level supervision, that is, that no one need know the specific meanings of detailed aspects of the signals. This paper discusses a fully neural type device which addresses this need. The device uses three principal stages, a wired multiresolution wavelet transform input section, a diffusion-based self-organizing stage for binding interchannel and temporal relations into macrosymbols, and finally, a standard distally-supervised associator network to the macrosymbols to high level meanings.

AB  - In many problems, as the complexity increases, the time and effort required to develop and train a neural network to an acceptable level of performance is often quite expensive. In our work on the interpretation of real-time epoxy cure process monitoring, we have found that subsets of the whole problem could be trained with relative ease, but that when the whole problem is introduced the training time grew exponentially and the results proved less successful. As a result we have developed a system of networks: 'experts', individual nets which are capable of solving small pieces of the problem, and an 'arbitrator' whose job it is to identify the truth teller from the several submissions. In addition, the arbitrator is capable of interpreting between experts for new data which does not track with any one expert. Such generalization has been more successful than that developed using single nets and is trained in much less time. The hierarchy has a mix of net architectures, including both recurrent and standard MLP configurations. Details of the ANNS formulation and results are included.

AB  - Neural net applications are relatively easy to develop in a software environment. Once the software has demonstrated an acceptable neural net performance it is often desirable to develop a consumer product in hardware. This paper illustrates how neural nets that were software trained can be implemented in an off-the-shelf Motorola 68HC11 embedded microprocessor system. The development of the 'Smarter Car' combining fuzzy logic control with neural is demonstrated.

AB  - The use of the interrelation between chemistry, physics and materials science to gain an understanding of matter is presented and discussed. Through real time interaction, animation, 3-D graphics and simple artificial intelligence, it is hoped that the student will gain a perspective of science not obtained from conventional textbooks. The format is to present a series of short modules each of which presents a concept which builds on the previous concept. Each module is expected to include a tutorial of the concept with graphical/animated illustrations and an interactive component which allows the student to test their understanding of the concept. Modules on atoms, electrons are given as examples.

Both data-driven and knowledge-driven influences in selecting the areas of interest and gathering the evidence are studied. We use the Bayesian networks for knowledge representation, and a decision theoretic approach in selecting where to shift the attention and for integrating the information from successive fixations.

AB  - The depth anesthesia were predicted with two different approaches using the Artificial Neutral Networks (ANN). In one approach, parameters derived from the autoregressive modeling of the Midlatency Evoked potentials (MLAEP) were used. The other approach involved the use of bispectral parameters derived from the EEG. As a result, it is shown that the ANN can be a useful tool in predicting the depth of the anesthesia. However, further tests are required to demonstrate the clinical viability of ANN.

AB  - The axillary lymph node is the principal site of metastases from breast tumours, whose presence is determined by axillary clearance or sampling. This paper reports on an attempt to determine axillary lymph node status from characteristics of the primary tumour. Three ANN architectures, the Multi-layer Perceptron, the Probabilistic Neural Network, and the Entropy Maximization Network (a new architecture developed by the authors), were used to analyse characteristics of the primary tumours of patients who had undergone complete axillary clearance. A comparison was made to determine which architecture made the most accurate predictions about novel patients.

AB  - There has been active efforts in computer aided engineering design in general and as applied to VLSI design in particular. VLSI design involves consideration of variety of parameters and needs abstract description at many levels. The initial yields are often very low, resulting in the return to design phase. As the complexity of the chip increases, the redesign problem becomes severe. In this paper, we discuss an approach that employs a set of cooperative knowledge sources involved in design process at various stages of VLSI design, interacting through a common blackboard architecture. A conceptual model based on blackboard architecture is introduced to manage knowledge associated with VLSI design. A case study on the design of VLSI floorplan is considered. The questions of designing the knowledge sources and managing the scheduling operations are simulated on a software framework. The framework enables one to generate, evaluate and come out with alternative design decisions.

AB  - The principal problem in the field of handwritten character recognition is how to deal with large distortions. Recently several methods have addressed to the problem based on the idea that personal handwriting is fairly stable even though the distortions from typical shape would be very large. Those methods adjusted their recognition dictionaries to each individual so as to decrease the difference between inputs and the dictionaries. Though the methods succeeded to improve the recognition rates, they needed enormous amounts of sample characters to personalize the dictionaries and this imposed users a lot of burdens. One solution for this is the utilization of computer handwriting model instead of actual human handwriting. In this paper, we examine the utility of the handwriting model, which we've already developed, as sample generator through simple recognition experiments on personal handwritten Kanji characters. The comparative study of the recognition results by using several kinds of recognition dictionaries demonstrates that the dictionaries made of the generated characters achieve reasonable recognition rates while dramatically reducing the number of real handwritten characters necessary in the learning stage.

AB  - This paper describes efficient and effective software testing strategies and environments for the Multi-Image Communication System (MICS). MICS consists of multiple processors called Intelligent Function Units (IFUs) connected by optical fiber loops. Efficient software testing is required because software configurations of such distributed systems tend to be complicated. In particular, software quality assurance in the IFU testing phase will be the key factor for efficient software testing. A series of software testing environments, which can apply a full load to the IFUs and MICSs, has been developed and used for IFU testing and system integration testing. A common platform for testing tools, which enables the testing tools to be used regardless of the testing phase, has also been developed.

AB  - Network management and broadband service and applications were introduced. What the 1980's were for the design of broadband communication architectures, the 1990's will be for the design of network management and control architectures. The relevance of network management to broad-band networks was identified by the CTR early on. The cross-disciplinary nature of the network management activity involves three related efforts supported by four thrust areas: traffic and fault management architectures (supported by the systems and software thrust); theory (supported by the systems, software and analysis thrust); real time implementation (supported by the VLSI and software thrust). In broad-band service and application, the research work seeks to generate knowledge, architecture and generic approaches to enable new broad-band applications based on image and video communications and access to multimedia databases. The cross-disciplinary nature of the broad-band service and applications focal project has three components supported by three thrust areas: general broad-band system (supported by the systems and software thrusts); distributed computing environment (supported by the software thrust); special purpose circuity (supported by the systems, software and VLS1 thrusts).

AB  - An intelligent controller for AUVs must be able to handle unanticipated events as they occur. If not, it risks the mission and the vehicle. Unfortunately, this is a difficult, context-dependent task : the agent must first detect that there has been an event, then diagnose it, assess its likely importance, and finally select an appropriate response and integrate that response into its other actions. Event handling is even more difficult in a situation involving multiple cooperating AUVs, since now the agent must analyze the event in terms of its likely impact the others and the group as a whole. In this paper, we discuss two versions of event handling in Orca, a schema-based AUV controller for ocean science and cooperative distributed problem solving missions. We then discuss how the process can be extended for multiagent event handling.

AB  - Unlike production engineering with its very high levels of automation, the processing industry is unable to do without man's powers of juedgment and adaptability. The advantages of artificial neuronal networks should not result in them always being selected whenever the analysis of a process's interrelationships requires a very great effort. They are no replacement for conventional automation.

AB  - Object technology is the latest proposed 'silver bullet' candidate for solving the software crisis, a situation wherein the complexity of systems increases with time. However, it seems too early to judge whether object technology will go the way of artificial intelligence and other such fads or, instead, become the unstoppable trend as predicted. A questionnaire was designed to get a better picture regarding the acceptance of object technology. Results indicate that organizations have just begun utilizing it for commercial application development, most of which are small and medium mainstream management information system-type applications. Productivity gains are modest, if any, on first projects. Object technology is expected to result in greater savings and higher quality systems.

AB  - Fuzzy logic and neural nets control systems were fused to achieve a better performance. The FI as it is called by the developer is designed for easier control of complex systems and will cut the need for shop-floor expertise. Fuzzy logic designed to cope with vague value alone can not give satisfactory performance because it is dependent to preset rules for a conclusion to be drawn. Neural nets work in coordination with the fuzzy rules. Technology aims to reach a given target value and the FI is a potential choice. Omron has put the FI technology into practice. It is percieved that FI technique will not be limited to machines but also to computer applications. FI processors is capable of automatic learning.

AB  - Despite of the availability of many sophisticated devices, the conventional switches and sensors used in applications such as level sensing still make up the majority of market, increasing at a rate of more than 7% per annum. Biosensors, smart sensors and devices that integrate artificial intelligence methods may help open new markets, but it must be kept in mind that they initiate from small existing bases.

AB  - Fuzzy logic is a branch of Artificial Intelligence and a programming method with the ability to make sense out of vague or incomplete inputs. FL continues to grow as a tool available to engineers. It is also being rapidly incorporated into products, though often without publicity. The reason is that a fuzzy approach can improve the performance, design time, or other measure of product quality to the point that it becomes a competitive advantage to be guarded. Here is an update on the technology.

AB  - The article formalizes the principle of immediate arrangement allowing one to create and process the information images of data interpreted as attribute value distribution nomograms. An algebra is introduced, for which the minimality of the system's relationships and operations by the data attainability criterion is proved. It is shown, that the language of the system's functions and predicates is sufficient for the development of an object-oriented programming language and the implementation of database machines.

AB  - A knowledge model for a complex real problem domain should be constructed using, as a rule, more than only one formalism. Modern knowledge base management systems provide users, knowledge engineers synthesizing knowledge models, with quite a range of formalisms for knowledge representation. But the question arises as to how to integrate in one hybrid knowledge model the appropriate knowledge model fragments written in different formalisms. The article describes the types of conceptual languages used in the knowledge base management system Kontsept. The integration of model fragments described in these languages is explained by their common denotation semantics and rests on the common relational structure of data representation.

AB  - The development of deductive databases, i.e. systems for coupling or integration of database management systems and logical deduction systems, is one of the central problems of artificial intelligence. In the present article this problem is considered as applied to relational databases for which the problem of efficient connection of logical deduction systems isn't trivial. The approach proposed rests on representing the structures to be coupled by structures used in tuple algebra. A new concept of databases is proposed, the concept of combined databases the implementation of which allows one to combine in a single system the advantages of search operations in database management systems and the advantages of logical operations in deduction systems.

AB  - The concept of an advanced intelligent network (AIN) for local exchange companies (LECs) has been in the works for years. The goal is simple: make the public network programmable, so that LECs can offer new services quickly and efficiently. Since 1989, the A-I Net family of products has blossomed into being the market leader for the AIN, and new services are being offered almost monthly by the LECs and other carriers using these components.

AB  - This paper introduces the REAKT (REA1 time Knowledge Tool) tool-kit from the implementation point of view. The Tool-kit is based on a blackboard model of multi-agent cooperation. The paper will thus deepen into some of its architectural characteristics, leading emphasis on practical issues. A particular C++ REAKT Model of Process Concurrency which makes extensive use of object-oriented techniques such as inheritance and polymorphism will be presented. The distribution of application features over independent processes, and the problem of scheduling periodic, and aperiodic processes in a REAKT-based real-time application will be also introduced. Finally, some figures about the performance of key toolkit features will be provided. Â© 1995.

AB  - RH&H's role in the HINT project was to focus on integration, finishing, utilisation, and marketability of the overall technological result. The other HINT partners were responsible for separate AI techniques and system units, which RH&H integrated to create a commercial product. To identify the industrial requirements of a commercial product, RH&H carried out a survey based on qualitative interviews with experienced, technical managers. We realised that to turn a R&D Project into a commercial product, it is crucial first of all to understand the industrial functional needs and the industry's way to conceptualise the world. Â© 1995.

AB  - This text describes our generic approaches to monitoring and prognostic, emphasizing the application of learning techniques, and focuses on model-free specific supervision entities that can be realized by a learning-from-examples method. All necessary tools for the generation of a supervised learning of a process situation classifier will be outlined. Statistical feature selection and inductive numerical learning constitute the basis for the proposed architecture. A particular supervised nonparametric learning method, developed in-house, the Q* -algorithm will be presented. Practical experiments for the monitoring of a lathe are carried out. Â© 1995.

AB  - The lack of a common framework for the uniform application of the solution techniques when developing intelligent process control system, have given rise to the HINT project (Heterogeneous INTegration architecture for intelligent control systems) whose main objectives are the design and realization of a supporting software architecture and the development of a methodology that allows the integration and cooperation of different control techniques (mostly, Artificial Intelligence-related) within a consistent computational environment. The aim is to deal with the real problems encountered in in-place industrial process control. Â© 1995.

AB  - Continuous state plants place specific demands on the structure and operation of multi-agent, multi-paradigm distributed intelligent controllers. A controller for a deep shaft mine winder is proposed. Its design demonstrates the choice of agents and how they interact to control a continuous-state plant. The controller is evaluated by means of a simulation study. The study shows that it is helpful to make a distinction between a priori and operational knowledge in designing intelligent controllers for continuous-state plants. Â© 1995.

AB  - Some of the theory-bound evolutional trends in real-time AI applications are pointed out based on analysis of essential properties of real-time systems as well as AI based systems. The evolutional mainstream is increasing interdisciplinary integration. Three subtrends are illustrated on examples: mechanical combination of methods, AI methods used for approximate solution of "classical" problems, and abstract methods applied in new domains. In addition similarity between integrated circuits and real-time systems design and increased use of formal verification at the early stages of systems development are pointed out. Â© 1995.

AB  - Implementation of process control of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) requires actuators, sensors and a "materials and processing" knowledge base. Improvements in quality and reproducibility of material deposits are achieved by using this knowledge base to drive the process toward desired operating regions. The knowledge base includes experimentally determined, empirical relationships describing the complex dynamical interactions of laser parameters. Intelligent control based on this description can be implemented to reduce process disorder and efficiently produce consistent coatings with desired properties. Â© 1995.

AB  - The transition from Boolean Logic to Fuzzy Logic is shown by modifying a ladder diagram consisting of discrete variables with values of 0 and 1 to include intermediate values. Properties of membership functions are discussed as they influence the control output. The concept of compromise and output blending is shown. Important observations regarding the presence of rules are presented. The notions of "gain" and "time" are introduced, and a PID controller using Fuzzy Mechanisms is shown. In one example, the level and temperature of a tank are controlled; in another example the engine power and the turning of the wheels of an automobile are controlled as a function of the gas pedal and the steering wheel excitation.

AB  - The paper discusses the methodological analogies and differences of the systems theory and knowledge-based approaches to modelling and simulating dynamical systems. This comparison is based on the notion of the dynamical system as defined in systems theory, in particular on the concept of state. Two examples show that these notions are relevant for quantitative models as used in systems theory and for qualitative models given in the knowledge base of a rule-based system. In addition, a formalisation is provided of rule-based systems within the concept of dynamical systems. It shows that the main motivation for using the knowledge-based approach in control engineering is the lack of information about the state of the physical system.

AB  - The heuristic search algorithm presented by Nilsson is commonly implemented with lists. However, the computational complexity of this implementation grows quadratically with the number of nodes being visited. The implementation presented has a computational complexity which is proportional to that number. Moreover, the storage requirements can be kept modest by introducing a late allocation strategy.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to discuss some positions, trends and future possibilities of CAAD and its AI support in connection with knowledge-based systems and the emerging cognitive and evolutionary paradigms of design. Problems of recognition and generation in designing architectural artifacts are surveyed. The capability to simulate design descriptions, generations and acceptance leads us to the concept of evolutionary redesign guided by tradition. Modelling of design intelligence at the level of evaluation of generitive design decisions makes it possible to explain improvement in design evolution. Real innovative design is connected to ideological revolutions and re-evaluations difficult to model. Customary rule relaxation in this context is discussed at meta-level using the concept of hyperconstituent. Real mastering of cognitive aspects in design calls for knowledge about design know-how, human emotions, volitions, expectations and skills. This makes it possible to investigate the harmonization of expert knowledge at master level in architectural decisions. The study of interpretation of design artifacts with cultural goals and values opens the way to recognize significant and important features in architecture considered as technology, art and science.

AB  - We present an experimental analysis of two parameters that are important in knowledge engineering for large belief networks. We conducted the experiments on a network derived from the Internist-1 medical knowledge base. In this network, a generalization of the noisy-OR gate is used to model causal independence for the multivalued variables, and leak probabilities are used to represent the nonspecified causes of intermediate states and findings. We study two network parameters, (1) the parameter governing the assignment of probability values to the network, and (2) the parameter denoting whether the network nodes represent variables with two or more than two values. The experimental results demonstrate that the binary simplification computes diagnoses with similar accuracy to the full multivalued network. We discuss the implications of these parameters, as well other network parameters, for knowledge engineering for medical applications.

AB  - Several studies documented substantial variation in medical practice patterns, but physicians often do not have adequate information on the cumulative clinical and financial effects of their decisions. The purpose of developing an expert system for the analysis of clinical practice patterns was to assist providers in analyzing and improving the process and outcome of patient care. The developed QFES (Quality Feedback Expert System) helps users in the definition and evaluation of measurable quality improvement objectives. Based on objectives and actual clinical data, several measures can be calculated (utilization of procedures, annualized cost effect of using a particular procedure, and expected utilization based on peer-comparison and case-mix adjustment). The quality management rules help to detect important discrepancies among members of the selected provider group and compare performance with objectives. The system incorporates a variety of data and knowledge bases: (i) clinical data on actual practice patterns, (ii) frames of quality parameters derived from clinical practice guidelines, and (iii) rules of quality management for data analysis. An analysis of practice patterns of 12 family physicians in the management of urinary tract infections illustrates the use of the system.

AB  - ISIS is a developmental decision support system that helps physicians select diagnostic imaging procedures. It uses case-based reasoning, an artificial-intelligence approach that emphasizes reasoning and planning from prior experience. The development, training, and evaluation of a prototype system were used to guide the development of ISIS. To realize a clinically useful system, particular emphasis has been placed on increasing the depth and breadth of case-based knowledge, enhancing the explanatory capabilities of the system, and refining the human-computer interfaces to include a critiquing approach.

AB  - Knowledge bases are more representative of the population of medical experts if they are constructed by a group of individuals, rather than one practitioner. However, one runs into problems with consistency when information is elicited from a group without a consistent format and terminology. This study examines the consistency of relatively unconstrained computer-elicited medical knowledge using the computer program, KSSO. The results of this study show that the group of ten general internists were somewhat consistent in the diagnoses they listed for a patient presenting with chest pain. They were much less consistent in the findings they listed to differentiate between the diagnoses they had listed. The mean number of subjects listing each diagnosis was 3.3 +/- 2.7 while the mean for findings was 2.0 +/- 1.5. The implications of these data are discussed.

AB  - Although knowledge is contained in many systems, moving it from one system to another is not an easy task because each system is tailored in its own unique way and because knowledge configurations are usually copyrighted. To populate our FRAMEMED knowledge base we turned to the NLM Metathesaurus as a readily-available open source of knowledge. We were disappointed by the greatly variable granularity of the concepts and the lack of definitions that could be borrowed. Some reference books in electronic form seem attractive but reformatting will require excessive human intervention and copyright negotiation.

AB  - The paper describes the design of the Intelligent Radiology Workstation (IRW) that is intended to handle heterogeneous radiologic data (text, image, video) and radiologic knowledge in such a way that it is easy to store, access, use, and repurpose. An object-based structure is used to combine the relational database, hybrid knowledge base, and hypermedia within a common framework. Functions such as data entry and retrieval, browsing, and intelligent processing of data are available in the single environment. IRW open architecture allows radiologic digital resources to be used for clinical practice, diagnosis support, education, and research.

AB  - There is a methodological similarity between simulation and expert systems techniques. The simulationist have a comprehensive understanding of the system to be modelled and the target simulation language. But, a simulation purpose expert system of queuing models developed in this study eliminates the knowledge required by the modeler of the target simulation language. The expert system presented here focuses on the stages of the stages of the simulation life cycle such as problem specification acquisition, model construction, model executing and making statistical inferences.

AB  - Cylindrical and SCARA type robots are very popular in the field of assembly and small parts handling. But those robots are facing technical difficulties to be quicker, though the market demands shorter cycle time year by year. We may say there is a technical limit to shorten the cycle time drastically if we only make the arm motion quick. This paper describes a new type robot which was developed by new concept.

AB  - In common with other ships' systems engine monitoring is widening both its scope and application. What used to be a slightly more sophisticated form of engine instrumentation is now an intelligent system offering fault finding, diagnosis, trend indication, event logging, and links to external computer and communication systems. Systems from the engine builders themselves are gaining in sophistication. New Sulzer Diesel's MAPEX system includes an expert system to help with planned maintenance and spares ordering, while the DENIS interface defines the standards for exchange of data between the engine and other manufacturers' control and monitoring systems. Wartsila's engine control unit provides data for trend monitoring systems and can also be linked to the company's Eldoc electronic multimedia engine manual. Servowatch of the U.K. says that its engine monitoring systems allow all normal monitoring and control to be undertaken on board but, in addition, engine builders can improve service to their customers by offering remote diagnosis and comprehensive service support.

AB  - Machine discovery systems help humans to find natural laws from collections of experimentally collected data. Most of the laws found by existing machine discovery systems describe static situations, where a physical system has reached equilibrium. In this paper, we consider the problem of discovering laws that govern the behavior of dynamic systems. We present Lagrange, a system that constructs a set of differential and/or algebraic equations from numerical descriptions of dynamic system behavior. We illustrate its use by generating a variety of dynamic system models from example behaviors.

AB  - A service operation system provides many functions, such as complete/ incomplete calls rate monitoring, network fault detection, customer care services and customer consultation. To provide these functions, the system needs to collect and process a large quantity of call attempt data, the network congestion information, the fault information and the customer information from the other systems. This paper describes the design concept of INMOS-V0, a service operation system for intelligent networks, and its functions in terms of where to get data from, data acquisition through the data monitoring equipment,. effective processing of call attempt data, and protection of network/customer information from sub-system failures.

AB  - Emerging intelligent vehicle and highway systems have created great enthusiasm about possible deployment of automated highway systems (AHSs) capable of assuming driver tasks. Many prior studies report that AHSs might enable vehicles to be operated in close-formation platoons on the highway, increasing highway capacity manyfold. This article explores several issues related to early deployment of close-formation platooning in existing exclusive-access high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. They are: platoon formation criteria, flow characteristics due to close-formation platooning, and infrastructure requirements to accommodate close-formation platooning. The results of this study suggest that the flow rate for one-lane HOV facilities due to deploying close-formation platooning is particularly sensitive to the relative proportions of cars, light-duty vehicles, and buses that use these facilities. Therefore, simple extrapolations of this estimated flow rate to multiple-lane HOV facilities or freeways may not be appropriate.

AB  - The main features and principles of using neural networks are analysed. These networks may be regarded as a new stage in developing expert systems, using not well-defined logic, learning and information that is not complete and not formalized. An expert system for vibro acoustic diagnostics of turbine machines has been developed on the basis of methods applied to neural networks and of a mathematical shell developed earlier. The system will not present the diagnostics, but give a variety of the most probable reasons, ranged by their probability degree.

AB  - This paper discusses the development of a new search algorithm for artificial intelligence systems. The search technique is based on the mathematical theory of the Cantor set. The search algorithm will be efficient for specialized search domains where the distribution of the data elements to be searched is approximately normal. The approach uses the iterative procedure of deleted middle thirds. This facilitates quick pruning of a search space. The new search technique has potential applications in computational systems with large input-output data handling. Extensive experiments comparing the Cantor set search (CSS) to binary search indicate that the new search technique holds good promise. Â© 1993.

AB  - Automatons require extremely precise instructions from operators in order to perform their tasks successfully. That is why algorithms for robust control software that would allow machines to be more flexible are being developed. The challenge for engineers is to calculate all of the variables that might be encountered and program them into the machine's controller. The very capabilities of the controllers can make them extremely difficult to program. A complex motion controller may have 800 parameters that need to be set for each application. Some control board manufacturers have developed block-diagram interfaces to simplify control system programming. Rather than producing an exhaustive list of all possible operating conditions and encoding them, some researchers advocate developing control systems that can respond selectively to a range of conditions. One method for adding flexibility to a control system is to include automated routines that approximate human decision making.

AB  - This paper explores preliminary design issues in simulating beliefs in corporate intelligent systems. The study integrates the two fields, belief system simulation and corporate intelligence. Belief system simulation has been carried out primarily within artificial intelligence. Corporate intelligence is a relatively new field in strategic planning within the business technology environment. This paper explores design issues in belief system simulation and suggests how such systems could be used as part of a corporate intelligence capability, increasing the scope and effectiveness of corporate strategic planning. The belief system of high-placed Japanese business and government leaders is the focus of this preliminary study. The specific issue chosen to illustrate the simulation model is the $25-billion American disk-drive market. The hypothetical user is a US corporate strategic planning group in a disk-drive company. The program illustrated in this study determines what changes occur if certain beliefs and belief factor values are input into a simulation system. For example, once having modeled the belief system of the competitor's executives and strategic planners, it would be possible to determine what effect specific beliefs and belief factors such as danger, confidence, importance and emotional charge will have on this belief system.

AB  - Mechanical design requires high-experience knowledge, and an expert system (ES) is effective in such a situation. A design process is generally changed according to the objective and constraint of the design and the designer's policy. Therefore, a flexible ES should be able to generate a design process. In this paper, an ES for mechanical design, which includes the design process generator, is developed. The authors propose knowledge representation for mechanical design and an algorithm to obtain the design process. To confirm the behavior of the system, this prototype ES is developed for the design of power transmission gear units. The system is written in LISP.

AB  - This paper describes an approach to automatic map generation for an autonomous vehicle. In the first phase, the vehicle is driven by a human through a corridor. During this phase, a vision system obtains many images with a TV camera mounted on the vehicle, and extracts features such as doors or staircases as candidates of landmarks. In the second phase, the vehicle system examines the extracted features and selects only useful features for guiding the vehicle. These features constitute a map for autonomous driving. Preliminary experiments are performed for an autonomous vehicle which moves in our building.

AB  - Great progress has been made in the areas of machine recognition (of speech, of military targets, and of marks on paper). Given this fact, I would never state uncategorically that OCR/ICR technology is generally over-rated. What I would rather emphasize instead is that customers seem to have unrealistic expectations about the real world proficiency of OCR technologies.

AB  - There have been recent reports made on a pattern recognition system using a neural network. However, difficult problems, such as how big a neural network should be adopted and which feature values for input of the neural network should be selected, have existed in the development of the recognition system. In this study, a new optimizing procedure for the neural network recognition system is proposed. Each output value for the nodes of the neural network after learning is used in the optimizing procedure. An optimum recognition system using a neural network for electrical discharge machining is developed as a good example of its application. The effectiveness of the optimum recognition system is proven to be practical in the electrical discharge machining process.

AB  - Two powerful techniques from AI-the use of heuristics, and state space analysis-are currently influencing the practice of pedagogy, particularly in mathematics. The current study compared the performance of college students on a mathematics task as a function of their exposure to each of these techniques. Specifically, it tested the hypotheses that instruction in the use of AI-type cued heuristics, and state space analysis (search) would improve students' solving of trigonometric identities (the target task), and their solving of group-theory identifies (the transfer task). Four conditions were developed in which the effects of cued heuristics alone, search alone, search and cued heuristics, and neither search nor cued heuristics were tested. A significant main effect of cued heuristics was found, but the positive effects of using cued heuristics did not transfer to problems involving group theory identities. Little gain was found for those using state space analysis. Implications for the use of these techniques in mathematics instruction are discussed. Â© 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) as science is concerned with psychologically viable computational modelling of agentive behaviour. An agent is characterized by an action-repertoire which it can deploy intentionally to bring about desired-for changes in the world (including itself). Systematic study of agentive behaviour, then, involves articulating computational architectures and computational processes relating to one or more of the several aspects of agents. In AI as engineering, on the other hand, the objective is to design a working AI system that exhibits some well-defined agentive behaviour, without necessarily worrying about homologies between the artificial system and the natural system. In this article we develop in some detail the above theses and outline problems and assessment procedures that confront research workers in AI.

AB  - The automatic face recognition is a very attractive problem and several solutions can be found in the literature. Most of them are based on the data provided by a classical CCD camera. This kind of information is relatively poor, and it is very likely that these techniques will fail in the case of a large database with a lot of people. The surfaces of the faces must be much more discriminating. Therefore, in this article we propose a stereovision algorithm which can be used for the acquisition of the surfaces of faces. The problem of matching between the pattern and its images is solved using the epipolar constraint and the local coherency constraint. Some experimental results are shown.

AB  - Most of the applications involving both vision processing and robotics require a camera-robot calibration phase. Many methods have been proposed to cope with this problem in the case of a fixed camera (static calibration) by using a calibration grid observed by the camera in its initial pose. If the camera is moving, the calibration step has to be processed again for each new position.

AB  - In this paper, we present an image processing system developed in order to automatically extract roadways and to detect potential obstacles in the planned path of the vehicle in a highway environment. The method requires the use of information related to the luminance signal in order to extract road borders, lane markings and obstacle candidates, and also the color signals which are used to improve the reliability of the road extraction step. Both these analyses provide a precise and robust road detection process which can determine the total maneuvering zone of the vehicle. Obstacle candidates are then searched within the detected lanes. After the static segmentation phase, a dynamic analysis can locate and follow, for some areas, potential obstacles which can generate a major risk for the vehicle in which the vision system is installed. Hardware processing time constraints related to vehicles on highways have been taken into account, and the developed algorithms are in the implementation phase for experimental purposes.

AB  - This essay provides a preliminary examination of the relationships which exist between the disciplines of communication and computer science. It isolates the original principles which determined the development of computer science and suggests how these early formative principles have and may continue to can affect the study of communication. Because of his seminal role in virtually all areas during the origins of computer science, the published works of British logician and mathematician Alan M. Turing (1912-1954) are employed as the foundation of computer science. Turing's conceptions of computability theory, computer architecture and software, artificial intelligence, and the origins of life are examined for their potential consequences for communication and rhetorical theory. It is argued here that both the limitations and the potentialities of the standards and interests which guided the emergence of computer science constitute an important self-reflective framework for future developments in the discipline of communication.

AB  - In the last decade, the operation of a spacecraft after launch has emerged as a major component of the total cost of the mission. This trend is sustained by the increasing complexity, flexibility, and data gathering capability of the space assets and by their greater reliability and consequent longevity. The trend can, however, be moderated by the progressive transfer of selected functions from the ground to the spacecraft and by application, on the ground, of new technology. Advances in ground operations derive from the introduction in the mission operations environment of advanced microprocessor-based workstations in the class of a few million instructions per second and from the selective application of artificial intelligence technology. In the last few years a number of these applications have been developed, tested in operational settings and successfully demonstrated to users. Some are now being integrated in mission operations facilities. An analysis of mission operations indicates that the key areas are: concurrent control of multiple missions; automated/interactive production of command sequences of high integrity at low cost; automated monitoring of spacecraft health and automated aides for fault diagnosis; automated allocation of resources; automated processing of science data; and high-fidelity, high-speed spacecraft simulation. Examples of major advances in selected areas are described. Â© 1993.

AB  - When composing computer aided design algorithms, it often proves useful to examine the following problems: how does the human designer plan and how does he handle parallelism and foresight. If we want to create a model of human designer planning methodology, we can use the artificial intelligence technology. In this paper we illustrate our approach by an example. The example is an autoplacer program for designing hybrid circuits.

AB  - The inadequate analysis of medical research data, due mainly to the unavailability of local statistical expertise, seriously jeopardizes the quality of new medical knowledge. Data Explorer is a prototype Expert System that builds on the versatility and power of existing statistical software, to provide automatic analyses and interpretation of medical data. The system draws much of its power by using belief network methods in place of more traditional, but difficult to automate, classical multivariate statistical techniques. Data Explorer identifies statistically significant relationships among variables, and using power-size analysis, belief network inference/learning and various explanatory techniques helps the user understand the importance of the findings. Finally the system can be used as a tool for the automatic development of predictive/diagnostic models from patient databases.

AB  - An optimum frequency reuse factor of 1 or 2 is proposed to minimise the average queueing delay and maximise throughput in a packet-switched microcellular network with BPSK transmission over dispersive Rician-fading channels. Thus, for intelligent vehicle/ highway system data networks, frequency reuse can be substantially denser than has been suggested for circuit-switched cellular telephony networks.

AB  - In this article we propose constraint based test generation as a new method for Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) in digital circuits, and describe a framework which makes it possible to uniquely handle a set of problems in currently existing ATPG methods, like the question of functional circuit modelling or the topological parallelization of the ATPG algorithm. The stated constructs (object oriented data-flow networks, the internal representation of network elements by dynamic binary constraint networks, the use of arc consistency algorithms, careful scheduling and a special dependency directed backtracking scheme) result in a high representational power and fast operating speed. Main concepts and reasons for decisions are shown before the details of a system architecture is presented. Â© 1993.

AB  - With the increasing application of large-scale and complicated systems in practical use, there is a need to develop systems on engineering work stations (EWS), in consideration of memory and speed of processing. However, it is very difficult to develop an application program with a graphical user interface (GUI) on an EWS. The authors have built a model of GUI based on the concept of object-model, and developed a function to create a source code of GUI by using this model. In this paper, knowledge representation of the model, the method for creating a source code of GUI by means of the model, and the method for controlling communication between the application and GUI are described.

AB  - The paper deals with the problems of knowledge synthesis and solution selection mechanism determination in game systems. The approach to the game systems as the real-time man-machine ones is studied taking as an example the autonomous system providing for true traffic safety in a navigation conflict. Such game system as any mechanical system includes general knowledge about properties of the physical medium of the objects interaction. It is shown that the only reasonable approach to the problem solution should be based on synthesis of such generalized subject-oriented knowledges, which gave an opportunity to generate local knowledges with any resolution required.

AB  - The definition for a class of artificial quantum objects being the simplest elements of the hypothetical nanodimensional design set, which is the set of means for creation of devices for information processing, is given. The quantum two-ports representing elements with two outlets, are considered. The properties of the two-ports are studied. It is shown that two different input states, for which the scattering transformation is the reflection with phase shift, exist for any quantum two-port. The rules of the two-ports composition necessary for the structure synthesis, are formulated. The existence of the corresponding group structure is revealed.

AB  - The paper with the approach of hyperrules which ensures local functional description for the processes of processing of information flows. Symbol-production systems and pipeline symbol-production (PSP) systems are considered. It appears that PSP systems are more convenient models for knowledge representation in comparison with predicative structures. It is shown that the use of decision tables (lists) has essential merits relative to decision tree. That's why the decision tables are in the basis of proposed formalism of hyperrules. The construction of knowledge bases with the use of hyperrules is carried out.

AB  - The article represents a review. The similarity is established between the models of homeostatic control by a set of parameters, the models of efficient behaviour in a group of automata, and the models of 'reasonable' behaviour in the distributed systems of artificial intelligence. It is demonstrated, that all these models reduce the process of solving a problem to the search of stable states, characterizing the achievement of the global objectives of control. The prospects are discussed for using the models of homeostasis and the automat group behaviour theory in the development of artificial intelligence systems, based on the paradigm, characteristic for network structures.

The HES with the proposed structure provides new opportunities to enhance the intellectuality of automated designing on the basis of expert systems technology. The scheme of HES components interaction in solving the problem of the article's image designing is given. An approach to the development of instrument means for HES shells construction, which also uses expert systems technology, is reported. The implementation of PROTEJ HES on personal computers is described.

AB  - This paper presents an example of how expert systems can be developed and used for planning structural piece-part production. First, expert systems are briefly and generically described. Then the production processes within a shipyard-like structural piece-part production facility are defined within an expert system 'shell'; that is, the 'objects,' 'attributes,' and 'rules' describing the production process are established and explained. Then various structural piece-parts are described to the system and the system identifies the required production processes for each described part. The inference process underlying the identification of these processes is described for each of these parts. Finally, potential applications of expert systems to other areas of shipbuilding operations are discussed.

AB  - In this paper some designs of the Boolean Neural Network, as one purely digital class of artificial neural networks, are discussed. We concentrate on applications of programmable gate arrays (PGA), programmable logic arrays (PLA), and commercial VLSI circuits. After a precise comparison of various types of neutral networks, a programmable cell array (PCA) is proposed, and a 2-dimensional array of logic and interconnection cell approach is suggested. The structured design of the PCA neural network is presented, and the characteristics of this network are discussed.

AB  - The formal model of functioning of multiparty political system in the conditions of individual and collective choice freedom is proposed. The equilibrium states of such system and their stability are investigated. The main aspect of the political system is the totality of decision making rules. The development of multiparty system state is simulated as relaxation process with minimization of average losses. The task of determination of equilibrium states of political system and investigation of their stability is reduced to determination and investigation of stability of local minima of latter extreme problem. It appears that the methods of solving of the task are close to the methods of optimal signal quantization. That's why the equilibrium conditions generalize the necessary conditions for optimal quantization and vice versa.

AB  - The problem of optimal quantization of one-dimensional distribution function under convex losses is considered. The system of equalities describing the necessary conditions of optimality is derived. It is proved that this system has unique solution for log-concave densities, i.e. the necessary conditions for optimality of quantization for log-concave distributions under convex loss function are also sufficient. The problem of search for optimal solution is formulated as the task of partition of sample space.

AB  - One of the new concepts for development of oil and gas reserves in 3,000 feet of water to be utilized by the Shell Auger tension leg platform (TLP) was proven over the past two years. Twelve of 32 planned well guidebase structures were installed on the seabed to within acceptable tolerances without the aid of a template. Key to this success was a precision acoustic positioning system, specially developed and proven in deep water field trials. A specially developed long baseline (LBL) acoustic positioning system was used to install the 12 well guidebases. Nine of the 12 well guidebases were installed within the required 1 foot tolerance of their target locations. The other three lie outside the 1 foot radius by 0.1, 0.3, and 0.3 feet respectively, all in directions perpendicular to the well pattern; i.e., away from adjacent wells.

AB  - Machine vision is a technology with roots that can be traced back to the 1950s, when forward-thinking scientists and engineers first marveled at its potential. Today, the science-fiction-like visions of yesteryear have become reality as manufacturers have come to regard machine vision as an intelligent sensor that is, in many applications, an integral part of a larger control system. As machine vision provides information about the manufactured product, the control system uses the information for closed-loop control of the production process. Using this approach, industrial manufacturers benefit in three ways: quality is improved, scrap is reduced, and yield is improved.

AB  - This paper provides a contribution of Qualitative Reasoning for continuous process supervision. It is now broadly agreed that the encoding of empirical and qualitative knowledge will be of important use for a totally computerized supervisory control strategy. Initial results in Qualitative Physics have been encouraging, but scaling the approach to realistic problems does not appear as straightforward as initially expected. Thus, Qualitative Physics may not be the right basis to deal with process supervision problems. An approach based on Transfer Function theory is proposed with an application study to a computer simulation of a distillation process. Using a numerical model of the process as a reference, the relevancy of the information provided by the Qualitative Transfer Function-based model is demonstrated. (A)

AB  - The Robotics Technology Group at the Savannah River Laboratory has developed expert mobile robots and control strategies for process applications. An expert robot is an intelligent machine that senses its environment, responds to its environment, and can perform independent tasks as outlined by a knowledge-based control system that incorporates artificial intelligence techniques. A real-time expert system is employed, whereby robots are treated as dynamic process elements in the overall process environment. The system has been implemented using a functional, layered control architecture. Decision, analysis, and control tasks are shared between the mobile robot actually performing the task and supervisory computers that interact with process data. Investigated are the control architecture and the performance of the laboratory development system. Â© 1992.

AB  - An associative memory can be defined as a transformation between two sets. Under mild conditions, the associative recall problem can be formulated as that of solving an equation of the form y = f(x), where y is known and the corresponding value x is not. Here, the associative recall problem is formulated in this way, and conditions on f are developed such that a contraction operator can be developed which solves the given equation. A specific piecewise-linear function is then chosen, and its associative recall properties are discussed. This associative memory is shown to converge rapidly and to have noise rejection properties and some learning capability.

AB  - While medical expert systems helped demonstrate that artificial intelligence was possible, few medical systems have been heralded as practical successes. We believe that expert systems will be practical successes if they cost effectively handle most of a physician's workload (i.e., routine care). To accomplish this goal, technology must appear invisible to the user; the system must be intuitive and anticipate users' needs. "Epileptologists' Assistant" is an example of our approach of combining a graphical user interface with an expert system and data base in a system to help in a routine specialty clinic. The goal is for two nurses and a physician to handle the workload of three physicians while increasing the quality of care. The current system reduces physician time by 66%. Our ultimate goal is to create a unified family of systems for medical specialties.

AB  - The analytic approach to signal processing performs well if there is adequate understanding of the characteristics of the signal source. In more complicated cases, syntactic signal-processing tools used to be a working alternative; however, these share the common algorithmic background with the numerical methods. On the other hand, the filed area of order statistics (OS) introduced into signal processing a number of tools that handle phenomena that the usual analytic theory could not even model. To grasp the essence of the filtering operation requires a kind of symbolical description, ambiguous and full of dependencies, creating a gap between the filed and other customary areas of signal processing. Thus, proper choice of an OS filter for a given application must be based on a mixed numerical versus symbolical evaluation of the signal features and goals, which is clearly outside the scope of normal signal-processing expertise. A possible solution to this problem is to interface the OS tool library to the user via an advisory layer capable of the integrated maintenance of the quantitative and symbolic information, supporting the user in the modelling, decision and evaluation phases of problem-solving. The study presented in this paper addresses the concrete case of OS signal smoothing, evaluating the components of the problem and presenting the structure of the intelligent front-end system.

AB  - With the ever increasing complexity and use of advanced technologies in the development of equipment and experiments in spaceflight, the possibility offers itself to automating repititious or very sensitive operations. The implementation of such automation lends itself well to teleoperations and the eventual introduction of artificial intelligence. In this paper the criteria for introducing automation are discussed, and its impacts examined. New problems such as command and control are discussed, with some guidelines suggested. Â© 1992.

AB  - This paper presents an artificial intelligence approach to integrated human-machine intelligence in space systems. It discusses the motivations for Intelligent Assistant Systems in both nominal and abnormal situations. The problem of constructing procedures is shown to be a very critical issue. In particular, keeping procedural experience in both design and operation is critical. We suggest what artificial intelligence can offer in this direction. Some crucial problems induced by this approach are discussed in detail. Finally, we analyze the various roles that would be shared by both astronauts, ground operators, and the intelligent assistant system. Â© 1992.

AB  - Electrical actuators are equipments for the conversion of electrical energy and signals into mechanical forces and movements. Sensors â used in connection with these actuators â are devices for the conversion of electromagnetic or mechanical units into electromagnetic signals. Both â actuators and sensors â become so intensively integrated, that the behaviour of electrical actuators is defined by the kind of sensorâcontrolling (and no more by its construction). Further trends are tried to be quantified by technical development curves versus the time, the trends to higher actuator speed and its limits, to intensive cooling and highâtemperature superconductivity as well as to further permanentâmagnet materials and last not least to intelligent electrical actuator systems.

AB  - The Tritium Emissions Reduction Facility (TERF) is an automated process that continuously removes tritium from process gases before they are discharged to the atmosphere. Key control parameters include: temperature, pressure, flow, oxygen content, total combustibles, moisture concentrations and tritium concentrations. The procurement of an industrial, microprocessor-based Distributed Process Control System was justified for TERF due to the critical nature and complexity of the system. A detailed performance specification was prepared and submitted to industrial companies who had demonstrated past success in the field of process control and instrumentation. The contract was awarded to the Foxboro Company, of Foxboro, Ma., who developed the new Intelligent Automation (I/A) Distributed Process Control System. A primary goal of the design team was that the control system increase TERF reliability and availability by automatically controlling system operation and by assisting the operator in the diagnosis of problems, preventative maintenance, alarming, report generation, and long term storage of data. The comprehensive continuous monitoring of the TERF process provided by the Foxboro I/A Distributed System is expected to: (1) optimize the system operating parameters and control the process better than was previously possible, (2) provide more alerts and alarms to aid operators in diagnosing and responding to problems, and (3) record and organize process data more effectively than before.

AB  - Few machine tools in use today fully exploit the diagnostic capabilities built into most CNC controls, and few people are willing to pay a premium to maximize the diagnostics they get with today's machine tools. The reason for this lies in the perceived value of machine diagnostics. This paper presents a variety of views on machine diagnostics, both from the people who build the controls and those who adapt them to machine tools, in order to aid the reader in deciding how valuable extended diagnostics would be in his next machine. These additional features include self-checking CNC controls, controls with graphical interfaces, remote diagnostics facilities, and systems integration aids.

AB  - The conventional data processing in the field of nuclear power plant monitoring and operation is difficult because of the wide variety of operating aspects that have to be taken into account and which are not easily programmed by conventional means. Artificial intelligence technology may provide a solution to this problem. Indeed, A.I. uses new techniques to manage data bases and makes it possible to formalize the operators' expertise and to automate the management of operators' technical knowledge. In 1986, the merits of expert systems in this field were demonstrated with a prototype coupled to an operator training simulator. The system is designed to help the operator to process all the electrically induced failures occuring in the facility.

AB  - This paper describes CHORIS, the Computer-Human Object-oriented Reasoning Interface System, a generic architecture for intelligent interfaces developed by the Intelligent Interfaces research group of the Lockheed Artificial Intelligence Center. The CHORIS architecture integrates several expert system modules to support intelligent operation and intelligent tutoring in an interface to complex, knowledge-based applications. The domain of interest in this paper is emergency management. As an intelligent interface, this system is designed to enable a wide range of users to interact effectively with varying types of these applications. The overall approach for CHORIS has been to design a set of domain-independent reasoning modules driven by domain-specific knowledge bases. To support both operation and embedded training in an intelligent interface, the necessary knowledge bases include: explicit models of the user (including canonical and role-based stereotypes), the domain (objects, relations, commands, and high-level tasks), and the interface itself. There are four separate reasoning modules within the CHORIS architecture. First, the Input/Output Expert supports a wide range of techniques for user input and output, including natural language, graphics, and voice. A second module, the Plan Expert, interprets user actions within a plan-based context in an attempt to infer user intentions and directly assist users in achieving high-level goals. The Adaptor Expert modifies interface features to best suit the current user and that user's ongoing tasks. The last reasoning module, the Presentation Expert, reasons about how best to present system information to the user, based on its nature and its intended use. The goal of embedding an intelligent tutoring capability within the interface is to teach and/or improve the human decision making processes involved in managing complex procedures, such as responses to natural disasters. CHORIS's instructional module utilizes existing knowledge bases to teach novices the basic principles of domains such as emergency management using the interface itself as an instructional setting. Case-based reasoning is currently under investigation as a technique for providing more real-world experiential instruction.

AB  - Expert systems perserve, analyze and combine the knowledge of seasoned human professionals. They are also valuable for teaching but they are best at solving well bounded, well understood problems. It is best to leverage the expert system by having it very accessable. The knowledge base must be constantly updated to be of value for forward looking problems. The article discusses actual operations for several expert systems being used to plan production, balance paint systems, diagnose machining problems and coordinate simultaneous engineering.

AB  - The paper describes humanitarian concepts and technological principles of cognitive systems, methods and procedures of knowledge acquisition. The structure of cognitive systems is considered for MOLE, AQUINAS, KRITON systems. The prospects of development of such systems as means for organizing new subjective fields on the basis of empirical and eclectic information are shown. Special attention is paid to the problem of processing of incomplete, vague and indirect knowledge. Now this problem is considered as practically unsolvable. The main cause is poor structureness of knowledge in practical problematic spheres, its hybrid character.

AB  - The approach for construction of control system of two-leg walking robot based on the tactile sensitivity principle is proposed. The control is realized by means of closed scheme with feedback relative to information obtaining from the leg. On the sensor output the dynamic tactile pattern which describes the dynamic of tactile pattern in the process of separate step realization is formed. The analysis of dynamic tactile pattern enables to conclude that given information contains the full knowledge for realization of walking. The use of this information gives the possibility to predict the following step. The general description of tactile sensitivity of walking robot is given. The information support of tactile system is considered. It is indicated that proposed method has some merits for robot control in unknown environment and non-predictive situations.

AB  - A new one-semester course is described in which undergraduate students in non-technical majors are shown how traditional philosophical problems of knowledge, cognition, language, and human nature can be fruitfully investigated with computer-related concepts and techniques. A series of simple experiments is used to demonstrate to undergraduates that mental phenomena are real, that they can be studied experimentally, and that they can be modeled insightfully in computational - i.e., information-processing - terms. Each experiment illustrates a basic fact or principle of cognitive science: the formal character of algorithms; creativity and the variants of the Turing test; limitations on human memories; the use of cognitive strategies; heuristic techniques of artificial intelligence; formal grammars and their associated parsers; social, societal, and anthropological dimensions of mind; and degrees of logicality in human reasoning. Students are also taught the essentials of PROLOG, a programming language that is based explicitly on formal logic, incorporating such notions as fact, database, and query, thereby lending itself readily to the description of complex relational networks of a sort not commonly expected to be amenable to computer analysis.

AB  - Lockheed has automated the processing of aircraft parts. The new automated system will chemically clean all sizes of parts by using a microprocessor to position a crane above the chemical cleaning tanks. An oxidation problem was discovered when parts were left in rinse tanks too long. The control software was re-written to reroute the parts. This project was the stepping stone for future AI Applications at Lockheed.

Since a message from a remote controlled robot can take 40 minutes or longer, robots must be able to percieve and interact directly with their surroundings. Autonomous robots will be required to analyze their surroundings and gather samples. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is necessary for autonomous robots to navigate rough planetary surfaces. AI is also helpful in ground control and analysis of information recieved by space exploration.

Advanced technologies in artificial intelligence (AI) could be implemented in order to cut manpower and processing time. The Shuttle Processing Data Management System furnishes information processing for ground operations. Efficiency studies have identified portions of the system which would be ideal candidates for automation. The new AI technology will be beneficial because it will free ground personnel from tedious information processing and allow more computer aided processing.

Some aspects of their application in information-search and intellectual systems are discussed. The processors of each class have merits and demerits, but enable to construct high efficient manufacturing control systems and object-oriented programs in the systems of control of data and knowledge bases. The algorithms, providing essential increasing of the speed of processing of symbol lines in comparison with software, are proposed. The evaluation of throughput of processors is given. Considered devices are applied for the design of co-processors for personal computers.

AB  - The paper deals with the problem of modelling of structured dismasting in knowledge base with the help of sign matrix of cohesiveness. The algorithm of dismatching decreasing is constructed. The matching forming of knowledge system in the process of knowledge acquisition is a very actual problem. Both semantic and structural matching are analyzed. One of the central questions of structured matching analysis is the choice of matching criterion. Evaluation of contents of knowledge base is discussed. Particularly, for solution of this problem authors propose to use the notions of conceptual clustering such as conceptual cohesiveness.

Particularly, generalized fuzzy ratios and extended fuzzy ratios are defined. The approach to the evaluation of reliability of realization of relation between fuzzy objects (fuzzy sets, subsets, elements) is proposed. The main idea of this approach is reduced to axiomatic definition of the function which defined the reliability of realization of ratio in quantitative form. Proposed methods enable to solve such important applied problems in artificial intelligence systems as the generation of elements of fuzzy sets, the realization of fuzzy algorithms, etc.

AB  - The Rocky knowledge-based authoring and development tools produced by Expert Edge Corp. of Palo Alto, CA, use knowledge representation schemes that are familiar and easy to understand, such as flow charts and logic trees. Previous to Rocky, the machinist would have to sit with a software person who would be called a knowledge engineer. Such 'engineers' would sit with experts, capturing their knowledge, and programming it so others could use it. Now, the job of knowledge capturing is simpler. Often, the machinist himself can make the program. Rocky is designed for end users, as opposed to just software people. Citing another example showing that artificial systems need not complex for the user, Omron Electronics Inc. of Schaumburg, IL, has designed a new fuzzy-logic module for its PLCs that can simplify programming and reduce software costs for many applications. The Model FZ-001 module uses fuzzy logic instead of conventional methods as an effective control alternative for difficult-to-automate systems.

AB  - Just visible from the top deck of Montparnasse-bound commuter trains as they accelerate away from Trappes is a colourful collection of intermodal handling hardware. Tucked away behind some sidings on a special test site are all the elements needed to build a fully-automated Commutor intermodal transfer station. Here hardware from rival suppliers is being put through trials that will allow SNCF to choose the technology for a prototype transfer station to enter service in early 1995. Commutor is even using Technology developed for handling nuclear waste at a fuel reprocessing plant.

AB  - It is reported that at a given Florida Water Treatment Plant, a 30 million gallon a day primary facility, raw water flow is split evenly between two tanks to maintain the desired amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This system splits raw water flow into equal aerated and nonaerated flows. Under any reasonable raw water flow rate, the splits are calculated and implemented properly using distributed intelligence. The system monitors raw water flow rate and also maintains the percentage of split within reasonable limits. The treatment plants and distribution systems are controlled through a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. A common function of the SCADA system is to regulate split water flow control. These flow splits occur both between treatment processes and between customers. The design of these flow split systems illustrates the role of distributed intelligence in a control system.

AB  - The questions of optimal stabilization of program motions of manipulation robot are studied. It is supposed that the robot dynamics is described by quasi-linear system. The quasi-optimal regulator is constructed on the basis of the method of Lyapunov function. The regulator is connected with electromechanical drives which carry out asymptotic stability of program motion. The algorithms of construction of optimal Lyapunov function and controlled function are based on linear electromechanical manipulator model. It simplifies essentially the procedure of construction of regulator.

AB  - The Intelligent Processing of Materials (IPM) used at the GE Aircraft Engines as a paradigm for improvbing the m,anufacvturing processes of a wide spectrum of materials is described. This integrated approach builds knowledge of materials processing and applies when automated process planning and control are used. Artificial intelligence is one of a number of tpools that can be used to codify and implement lessons learned about materials processing. This paper illustrates the IPM approach by focusing on the sapphire single crystal fiber produced using the edge defined film fed growth (EFG) process. This has resulted in a two-fold increase in the yield of high grade fiber and an order of magnitude reduction in fiber cost.

AB  - Integrated model of the object of design in mechanical engineering is proposed. The model is constructed on the basis of the models of object details and enables to give a technological analysis of object's structure. The results concern standardization and unification of topologic and geometric models of design models. The authors use artificial intelligence methods for creation of computer-aided design system. Application of artificial intelligence enables to replace traditional problem of analysis by general problem of synthesis of geometric form which is solved together with the problem of supplying of technologic properties. Considered structure of the object model enables to computerize synthesis and analysis of object form. The model is supposed to be used in intelligent computer-aided design system.

AB  - The article is devoted to problems connected with knowledge processing in intelligent systems. A knowledge base is taken to mean a choice function corresponding to the problem area being investigated. The problem of synthesizing the knowledge has been solved earlier for this case by the authors. In the present article, the conditions for existence of solutions are investigated and algorithms are developed for constructing solutions in classes of problems for which the knowledge base can be represented by an extended choice function.

These ordering operations take into account information about operands more completely in comparison with Zade operations. Ordered lists of operands are the result of application of ordering operations. These lists are compared with each other lexicographically. Ordering operations are guided by processing of information in discourse models used in various intelligent systems, for example, in expert systems of medical and technical diagnostics, intelligent decision making systems, etc.

AB  - Inverse problem of knowledge synthesis is considered. Authors suppose that new knowledge (likelihood hypotheses) and conditions of knowledge matching is given and one has to determine co-ordinate knowledge, i.e. knowledge about subsystems or about investigated phenomena and processes. Inverse problem can be interpreted as cleaving the general conception of system choice to partial conceptions of subsystem choice. Matching synthesis of subsystems enables to restore initial conception. Knowledge bases are given formally by the choice functions and corresponding choice fields. The connection between matching function and other characteristics of knowledge bases is discussed. The conditions of existence of inverse problem solution are derived.

AB  - An automated adviser system is suggested which may become a certain amount of maintenance work depending on state of equipment. The use of 'artificial intelligence' principles permits to develop such adviser system: the information expert system (INFES) based on expert system-shell (ESS). Specialized programme complex (SIMID) (small information model for information decisions) is used as ESS methodology and instrumental base. Connected with each other semantic groups form semantic network shown in a figure. Semantic network connects geometry of a hydrogenerator with defects detected by inspection. As data accumulated structured network may be changed and added by new semantic groups and elements. A software for the INFES has been developed to estimate the state of the stator core in a hydrogenerator.

AB  - Traditional computer packages for the analysis of complex engineering problems such as fatigue analysis using Fracture Mechanics, are often very difficult to use and require the user to have some detailed knowledge about the internal structure of the program, in addition to understanding the analytical problems. Such programs are often intended to be run in batch mode on a mainframe or mini-computer with all input and output in the form of files. However, FACTS (FAtigue Crack growTh Software), a new software package for the fatigue analysis of welded tubular joints, overcomes these difficulties by using interactive input and output and by using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based system to help and guide the user with problem definition. This paper gives a brief overview of the features available in the FACTS package and then describes in more detail the program architecture and how AI techniques are used to simplify program use for the user and to simplify the internal program structure.

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence techniques and paradigms in real-time control can potentially form a powerful combination with interesting synergistic effects. This paper argues that initial exploratory work must be followed by long-term strategies to ensure that evolving AI technologies will integrate seamlessly with existing and future real-time systems. A system approach to the design of such systems requires a framework that addresses the key issues of knowledge, time and distribution. We propose a 'bulletin board model' that provides the necessary infrastructure to support such a framework. Â© 1992.

AB  - This paper introduces a knowledge-based approach to ensure the integrity of information in a real-time database (rtdb). A form of explicit clock temporal logic (called TLrt) useful in specifying timing constraints on controller actions, rtdb items, and constraints in a real-time constraint base (rtcb), is presented. Timing as well as other forms of constraints are stored in the rtcb. The rtcb is realized as a logic program called Constrainer. The consistency issues for an rtdb and rtcb are investigated. The formal bases for a temporally complete rtdb and knowledgeably complete controller are presented. A partial TLrt specification of a knowledgeable controller for a Gas Burner is given. An illustration of a rtdb and rtcb in the context of the sample real-time system is also given. Â© 1992.

AB  - The future of intelligent control systems depends upon the extent to which Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology can help control engineers deliver practical solutions to difficult control engineering problems. Conventional control design approaches have achieved notable successes in the design and implementation of robust, adaptive controllers for systems with well-defined mathematical models. However, conventional approaches have had difficulty supporting engineers in the design and implementation of control systems when an accurate mathematical model is not available. Also, verification that computer-controlled systems perform to specifications, validation of the specifications, higher-level control, operator decision aids, system diagnosis, operator alerting, and reconfiguration of systems which experience large changes over time or potentially catastrophic failures are significant challenges to control science and engineering. It is in these difficult areas where the AI technologies of knowledge representation, learning, search, diagnosis, planning, and decision are being used to aid control engineers. Algorithms for computer-controlled systems and software tools to help implement these algorithms have been a subject of research and commercialization for decades. Computer-Aided Control Engineering (CACE) tools have achieved a degree of success in the past decade based on their ability to assist in the control system design and implementation process. Specialized tools have been made available for system identification, system simulation, controller design and controller implementation. Recently, efforts have been made to build integrated CACE environments. Also, some current research is aimed at increasing the utility of available systems by creating a mathematical basis and a software architecture for efficiently describing complex systems and using these as a means of achieving a higher level of integration of the diverse tools already available. A recent Workshop on Software Tools for Distributed Intelligent Control Systems was sponsored by the U.S. Army and The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). This paper will describe the results of the workshop and subsequent efforts to use these results to shape a DARPA software development project. The first section of the paper provides a brief review of the current applications of AI in the design and implementation of control systems. The second section discusses areas where AI can be applied in the near term to help solve challenges in the implementation of computer-controlled systems. The third section gives an overview of the development of CACE tools. The fourth section provides a review of the Army/DARPA workshop and the last section discusses the use of the results of the workshop. Â© 1992.

AB  - This essay is to point out some of the basic differences between conventional and real-time applications of AI and to provoke discussion on whether or not a new paradigm would facilitate better understanding of these differences. Some of the listed differences are illustrated by examples from references. An attempt has been made to project existing AI methods onto the deduction-induction axis so as to find an analogy with human behaviour under hard real-time constraints, e.g. reflexes. The conclusion is that the developers of real-time AI methods might benefit by using a "reflex based" paradigm. Â© 1992.

AB  - Humans are adept at providing accurate statements of confidence in their perceptual identification and recall memory responses. In spite of this, mechanical pattern-recognition systems and other artificial intelligence devices seldom express response certainty. The purpose of this paper is to show how useful confidence ratings can be in integrating the results of a variety of pattern-recognition systems to produce a single, optimal decision concerning the target to be recognized. We outline several ways neural network pattern-recognition systems could be modified to issue confidence ratings with each classification response. In sketching a mechanical system of confidence ratings we find we have also provided a preliminary framework for understanding human confidence judgments and human metacognition.

AB  - In this paper, we describe DESKS (Developmental & Experimental Support for Knowledge-Based Systems), an integrated software package designed to support the development of advanced knowledge-based systems, including expert systems and other AI applications. DESKS follows the Fifth Generation approach in adopting a logic programming paradigm (Prolog) as the mechanism for application development. It provides system designers with an interacting set of sophisticated tools and database facilities to assist in the development process.

AB  - This study deals with task planning for disassembly/assembly of machine units by robots. This paper describes an algorithm for generating disassembly/assembly working, which is based on a data model of the assembly structure described by connective relations among parts. The algorithm can be divided into four stages. In the first stage, the disassembly sequence of machine units by robots is generated. In the second stage, the task is expanded to macro commands with task modules for disassembly. In the third stage, the macro command for assembly is changed by the macro command for disassembly. In the fourth stage, the macro command is expanded to the command in the work level. This algorithm is implemented as a knowledge-based system in Prolog. We have verified the effectiveness of this algorithm for experiments on disassembling/assembling machine units by robotic manipulators. Â© 1991, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - A valuable technique during concept development is rapid prototyping of software for key design components. This approach is particularly useful when the optimum de sign approach is not readily apparent or several known alternatives need to be rapidly evaluated. A problem inherent in rapid prototyping is the lack of a âtarget systemâ with which to interface. Some alternatives are to develop test driver libraries, integrate the prototype with an existing working simulator, or build one for the specific problem. This paper presents a unique approach to concept development using rapid prototyping for concept development and scenarioâbased simulation for concept verification. The rapid prototyping environment, derived from artificial intelligence technology, is based on a blackboard architecture. The rapid prototype simulation capability is provided through an objectâoriented modeling environment. It is shown how both simulation and blackboard technologies are used collectively to rapidly gain insight into a tenacious problem. A specific example will be discussed where this approach was used to evolve the logic of a mission controller for an autonomous underwater vehicle. Â© 1991 by the American Society of Naval Engineers

AB  - In the paper the algorithm of the 'naive' Bayesian classifier (that assumes the independence of attributes) is extended to detect the dependencies between attributes. The idea is to optimize the tradeoff between the 'non-naivety' and the reliability of approximations of probabilities. Experiments in four medical diagnostic problems are described. In two domains where by the experts opinion the attributes are in fact independent the semi-naive Bayesian classifier achieved the same classification accuracy as naive Bayes. In two other domains the semi-naive Bayesian classifier slightly outperformed the naive Bayesian classifier.

AB  - Extending the capabilities of computerized measuring systems from mere data processing toward intelligent behaviour claims intensive application of knowledge based and other artificial intelligence originated algorithms. The paper presents a scheduler architecture, which provides a framework for integrating knowledge based and traditional data processing algorithms under real-time operating conditions. For keeping the scheduling task computionally tractable the scheduler extensively uses heuristic approach.

AB  - Representation of the work of parallel systems by means of a set of marked partially ordered sets (routes) is considered. An efficient procedure for generation of a set of all routes for systems is constructed where route expressions of a special kind are used to describe correlation of parallel working subsystems. The COSY (concurrent systems) language is used for specifications and analysis of the class of considered systems. By means of the language a system is represented as the whole, consisting from executive and restrictive parts. The restrictive part is a set of synchronizing descriptions and the executive one is a set of route expressions of special kind. The correctness of construction of set of all routes is proved for an arbitrary parallel system.

Adaptive and non-adaptive control of robot manipulators are compared in the case when robot parameters are varied and unknown a priori. The main goal of the paper is to determine the criterion of applicability of adaptive control for manipulation robots. The robustness and stability of robototechnical system are investigated. The necessity of adaptive control for robototechnical system stabilization is established.

AB  - Algorithms of synthesis of program motions of multilink manipulators are developed. Algorithms are based on the solutions of inverse kinematic problems regarding velocities and location and on the relations, generalizing known formulas for the case of system nonstationary parametrization. In the case of kinematic redundancy of mechanism optimal program motion which minimizes kinematic energy is synthesized. On the basis of considered algorithms the complex of programs for kinematic synthesis and analysis of robototechnical system has been developed.

AB  - A powerful new signaling system that functions as the neurons of the intelligent network is spawning a host of revenue-generating services. Known as Common Channel Signaling System 7 (CCS7), it separates telephone signaling from the voice path, greatly increasing the amount of signaling information that can be exchanged by switches and providing access to a variety of databases. An essential part of network evolution, CCS7 combines digital switching, digital transmission, signaling, and databases to extend existing services beyond a single switch; ties together islands of ISDN; and permits creation of entirely new services.

AB  - The intelligent network is a pivotal development in the telecommunications industry: it facilitates distribution of intelligence that controls calls throughout the network, and allows rapid development and deployment of new services by service providers. Among these new services are routing-oriented capabilities, like Area Number Calling, which routes calls to a business location nearest the customer. For example, a pizzeria with six stores in the same city has a single phone number, and a customer's call is routed automatically to the nearest store. Other examples of smart new services are circuit-oriented services like voice messaging and fax store and forward. The intelligent network also lets services providers - and their customers - tailor services to suit their needs. AT&amp;T is launching a group of products called the A-I-Net(TM) product family. Together, the products enable service providers to create new services; install and provide the services through intelligent network elements; and manage the entire enterprise through a single system.

AB  - Local area networks (LANs) have proved to be a popular and productive means of sharing resources and distributing computing throughout organizations. However, their very popularity has led to a rapid growth in the size and number of LANs and to the consequent problem of how best to manage them. One approach involves distributing intelligence throughout elements of the network, allowing them to control networks at the local level and report back to central network management systems.

AB  - Alcatel 1300 network management systems offer a global approach to the management of telecommunications networks which complies with CCITT recommendation M.30 and the Q.3 interface. A fault tolerant NMC manages the TMN and its future evolution, and also supports some operations and maintenance applications. NMUs connected to the data communication network can be added to support other applications and fit in with the network operator's functional and geographic organization. Distributed terminals can be located where appropriate, either local to or remote from an NMU or NMC. The Alcatel 1000 E10 and S12 digital switching systems communicate with the common platform via the Q.3 interface. Other network elements will be upgraded with mediation functions and devices, as necessary.

AB  - Developments during 1990 are highlighted. Boundary scan, a method for designing testability into microelectronics and printed-circuit boards, came to market in 1990 in an array or products ranging from application-specific ICs (ASICs) to logic analyzers. The field of communications testing was marked in 1990 by the bid of a new analysis technique, modulation domain analysis, for mainstream applications inside and outside communications, including disk-drive testing. The adoption a few years ago of a standard for the VXI (VME extensions for instrumentation) modular instrumentation bus is finally bearing fruit in a cornucopia of new products. A smart tester, incorporating artificial intelligence techniques, came on the market. Â© 1991 IEEE

AB  - This report describes a study carried out at the Technical Research Centre of Finland to develop an expert system to support safety analysis of process systems, especially Hazard and Operability Study. A flexible tool could contribute to the application of Hazop in the early phases of process design and thus increase system safety. The outcome of the project is a prototype called HAZOPEX, which includes extensive knowledge about potential causes of deviations, less knowledge about consequences or measures, but still has weaknesses of a research prototype with the user interface. HAZOPEX makes use of the process structure described to the system as linkages between process components. The functions of the prototype as well as the new method to trace potential causes of disturbances from the structure are described in the report. The prototype has been applied in two small cases with partners outside the project group and the results of the experiments are reported. A summary of the development needs is presented and a specification of an advanced version of HAZOPEX is given in the appendix.

AB  - A word recognition system using network representation of acoustic phonetic segments is proposed and tested on a speaker-independent isolated word recognition task. The system has four major features, (1) context dependent segment modeling, (2) rule-based generation of networks of acoustic phonetic segments, (3) direct matching of input speech against networks and (4) usage of mel-cepstra and matrix representation of segments. Average error rates for the 10 male speakers were 0.6% for the 53 city names and 2.3% for the 220 words. They were 1/5 and 1/3 of those by the whole-word multiple template method, respectively. These results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Each level has its own purpose, vitality responsibility and possesses a certain freedom of action that reflects the purpose of this level and its intellectual capabilities. Each subsequent level is responsible for correct action of the elements of the preceding level, their interaction with each other, i.e., for coordination of activity. In the first place the latter consists of gathering information, calculating interaction of individual parts of the lower level being controlled on the basis of this information and production of control actions.

AB  - Standard models of decision-making provide normative methods for analyzing quantitative assessments of decision situations. These models are inadequate for most problems in artificial intelligence because they do not specify how to acquire assessments, and they depend on a complete, combinatorial model that requires too much data to assess. This paper presents a brief overview of some of these models and proposes an alternative methodology, constructive decision-making, that addresses some short-comings of normative models in knowledge-based paradigms. An implementation of the constructive decision-making, that addresses some short-comings of normative models in knowledge-based paradigms. An implementation of the construction decision-making approach is described.

AB  - The article describes the artificial intelligence-based fault-diagnosis tool for broadcasting systems under development at the CERLOR. After a review of some of the principles of artificial intelligence and expert systems, there follows a review of the state of the art concerning the application of experts to fault diagnosis. Particular attention is given to the different ways in which knowledge may be represented: deep knowledge and shallow knowledge, and a presentation of the so-called second-generation expert systems which use both these types of representation simultaneously. After this general introduction, the article describes the work of CERLOR in this field and explains the expert system architecture adopted in the STEAMER fault diagnosis system. To validate the generator and the concept of expert systems in maintenance in the wider context, an application has been developed for a 2 Ã 25-kW television transmitter. This is described in some detail. Finally, the authors review the principal results of a TDF enquiry into computer-assisted maintenance (CAM) and the prospects for further development of STEAMER.

AB  - Autonomous transport robots (ATRs) with artificial intelligence elements must be able to travel within a given region that contains rough terrain sections as well as a road network. A priori knowledge about the locality, which can be obtained from the topographical map of the travel region, is necessary for ATR operation. In this paper, we consider the process of forming a knowledge base and a route assignment for an ATR. This process consists of the following stages: input and digitization of the map image; representation of the map image in 'pseudo-color,' and preparation of the i-th sheet of the electronic digital map; cataloging of the i-th sheet of the electronic digital map; preparation of a cartographic knowledge base; and formation of the route assignment for the transport robot. The structures of cartographic data and knowledge, the basic stages of input and processing of the topographical map image, knowledge preparation and formation of the route assignment for the ATR that are considered in this paper have a program support in the MS DOS environment on an IBM PC with an EGA adaptor and a color monitor.

AB  - The article discusses how Honeywell marketing and research specialists are identifying the requirements and developing answers to the complex demands for sensors in a fragmented industry. The strategy for sensor development for the food and beverage market is two-part: to address sensing needs from a functional requirement standpoint, which allows a perspective more similar to that of the customer; and to develop a family of sensors that address specific needs of the market, that are versatile, interchangeable, and can be combined to perform a dedicated function.

AB  - We are developing a novel real-time expert system to monitor the performance of a triggering system in a high-energy/nuclear physics experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Experiment 814). The system runs on an 80386 processor that is completely independent of the data-acquisition computer for the experiment. Artificial intelligence techniques are seen as especially important for the diagnostic capability of the system. In particular, a separation of the diagnostic knowledge from the control procedures facilitates modification of the expert system and hence the diagnostic capability of the overall system. This is highly desirable as changes in the trigger conditions often occur during the course of a physics run. In addition, one of the objectives of this research is to develop a system which is capable of detecting fault conditions in a serial trigger processor and to aid in locating their cause. Â© 1990.

AB  - Currently, an intelligent machine can be created by employing expert systems or neural networks. Unlike an expert system, which contains codified sets of rules, a neural network makes up its own rules that match the data it receives to the result it's told is correct. A neural network is thus more flexible in its recognition of patterns, and is capable of adjusting. Neural network technology not surprisingly offers a variety of applications, including military vision systems, a highly accurate explosives detection system for airport luggage developed by science applications, and a neural network mortgage-loan risk analyzer developed by nestor inc. Other applications currently being developed include financial data analysis, machine movement, speech recognition, and telecommunications signal processing. The attempt to create a neural computer has led to the development of neural network integrated-circuit chips which are described.

AB  - Recent developments in the power industry have put a premium on continuous, on-going maintenance programs for old plants. Plant owners are recognizing that formal maintenance starting as early as possible in the plant's life, rather than late-in-life restoration projects, is a must. This trend is occurring for both fossil and nuclear capacity. The major development on the fossil side is the demise of life extension as a strategy for dealing with old capacity. This is due to the fact that a life extension project at an old power plant will trigger the kind of air-pollution emission limits imposed on new plants, which in turn will require the retrofitting of expensive air pollution, control systems. Instead a new strategy, called 'life optimization', is advocated. The essence of the strategy is reliance on preventive and predictive maintenance to hold down the costs of aging caused by low availability and repairs. Maintenance must be a method of reducing operating costs, not an added expense item, as it has been traditionally. For this purpose, the author urges the incorporation of expert system techniques into diagnosis using the improved, on-line data available from improved sensors and computers. He also urges the use of a technique called reliability-centered maintenance, a new approach to organizing and planning power plant preventive maintenance.

AB  - An intelligent CAD to generate an interlocking sheet has been developed, the design of which depends on an object orientation scheme. If the designer draws a track layout on the screen, then adds extra information, the system generates an interlocking table automatically. Based on a set of points specified by the user, the system can anticipate what he wants to do. A tree search technique is applied to both extracting the route from the layout and modifying the locking requirement of the route. A data structure based on frames is implemented to combine object orientation and tree search. An example cited will help in understanding the process of generating the interlocking table from an object network obtained by drawing a track layout.

AB  - Recently, with a strong interest in needs and rapid development of application software, Boiler Operation Guidance System for power plants utilizing so called expert system and expertizing diagnosis of plant diseases has been introduced as an application to actual plants. Since the combination of operating conditions of the boiler for power plant are complicated, knowledge which Boiler Operation Guidance System should deal in will be huge. The most important point with utilizing this Boiler Operation Guidance System is to organize and demonstrate this huge knowledge base. And the final task to be solved for practical use of this system is how to verify the system by reproducing plant disease. From this point of view, cooperation of plant user and plant manufacturer becomes much more important in bringing about these kinds of systems.

AB  - We have developed the expert diagnosis system for the FJR710/600S engine installed for the quiet STOL research aircraft 'ASUKA' that was flight-tested by National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) at the self defense air force base at GIFU Prefecture, for the application to the actual engine trouble-shooting. This expert system has been designed with conventional expert program on the small-sized personal computer, not only from the economical point of view but also from the viewpoint of operational convenience. The main objects of this system are to compile and integrate the knowledge of engine trouble-shooting and to verify the ability of diagnosis by small scale expert system. In planning the system, we have concentrated on system simplification and methodology of information compilation. This present paper describes the outline and the estimation of the system.

AB  - Novakovskiy [1] analyzes degradation of operability of communications by electromagnetic waves with space vehicles as they recede from Earth, and he concludes that for flights to distant planets of the solar system, and the more so to the nearest stars, operational communications will become 'impossible in principle,' since the signal transit time will be hours or years rather than minutes. On this basis, the author arrives, in my opinion at the unecessarily pessimistic conclusion: 'until automatic interplanetary stations (AIS) and interplanetary spare vehicles are built, traveling at a speed close to the speed of light, and new communications means with faster-than-light signal transit speed, flights to the nearest stars and distant planets of the solar system remain unrealistic.' I would like to compare the following with Novakovskiy's arguments.

AB  - Until recently, decision support systems for use in control applications had focused primarily on modeling the purely electrical aspects of a network. This was an avowedly indispensable phase of development that led to the production of highly accurate digital tools. The development of symbol-based information processing systems has paved the way for more comprehensive and flexible tools. The tools are more comprehensive insofar as network control is often reliant on rules that are difficult to model in algorithms but that can be taken into account more easily by an expert system. Further, although algorithms are able to provide a rapid answer to the question of how to modify the command variables of a particular system, they are generally ineffectual in selecting the relevant variables; expert systems are therefore more flexible than previous generation tools. A graphic network-display system, forms the hub of the system described, around which the symbolic, digital end user interface modules are architectured.

AB  - Now-a-days, automatic inspections of materials are widely used. There exist many possible systems for data loading but in the meantime the automation of signal evaluation is still at a research stage. Currently large volumes of data are characterized manually and this often leads to stagnation in the inspection timetable. In recent years Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems more or less successfully take the leading role replacing manual evaluation with computer decision systems. The efforts are concentrated towards increased realibility and accuracy of data processing evaluation. This paper describes general facts concerning development of Artificial Intelligence methods for pattern recognition. Certain characteristics and practical results of ultrasonic signal analysis are presented as well. More sophisticated achievements are expected in the near future.

AB  - Retrofits extend service life, save fuel, and reduce pollution. Modifications can add control systems that regulate combustion, remove sludge and sediment, and check fuel viscosity. Artificial intelligence may help make faster, more accurate decisions to maintain power plant operating tolerances. Retrofitting may involve a minimum of hardware, or it may include major hardware replacements such as a change from pneumatics to electronics, or the use of computerized digital control systems. Modifications are often spurred by the need to satisfy pollution reduction requirements.

AB  - Sheet metal accounts for a high proportion of components made by Oxford-based electrical switch gear manufacturer, W Lucy & Co. Most of the switchgear is specialised, tailored one-offs or small batches with correspondingly small batches of sheet metal parts. One consequence of this has been wastage during guiliotining and punching: only 40 to 45 percent of the 1450 tonnes-a-year throughput of galvanised and mild steel sheet ended up as components. It was therefore decided to invest in a Nisshinbo Turret-Type punching machine driven by a CAD/CAM system using artificial intelligence software. Besides metal savings with utilisation increased to 75 per cent, faster part-programming by CAM has been achieved. The combination of CNC and CAD/CAM has greatly increased punched component production. The current record is six tonnes of sheet steel processed by the Nisshinbo in one day, producing 160 different types of part in batches of one to 40 in three sheet thicknesses. This compares with 1 1/2 tonnes average on other CNC punching machines.

AB  - The authors consider the problem of extending the functional possibilities of man-machine interaction by designing an adaptive dialogue structure. Under such an approach, the interaction structure in the dialogue process is transformed, leading to various modifications of graphs of dialogue procedures, which in turn assures flexibility of man-machine interaction. This allows one to construct a closed model for the process of adopting an interactive scenario to the heuristics of a user operating in an arbitrary subject domain.

AB  - Today, paper customers want higher quality and more responsive service - at highly competitive prices. These market demands will only get tougher as end-users strive to gain a strategic position in a gradually-softening market. Such pressures are causing mills to look for new process automation approaches - systems that closely support the mill business strategy right on the production floor. One of these new 'strategic automation' concepts is that of the real-time, online expert system. The real-time expert system applies expert knowledge to the running of a process. It maintains ongoing monitoring of the process, in real-time, and updates operators on currently-advisable process-management decisions. The real-time expert system is projected to have the largest growth rate of all the expert systems applications. This article discusses the highlights of a pair of real time expert systems being implemented recently and talks about the future of these kinds of systems.

AB  - The rapidly growing sophistication of manufacturing and processing is demanding a corresponding improvement in maintenance delivery systems. The pressure to keep pace is continually building on already hard-pressed maintenance organizations. To reduce this pressure and ease the maintenance task, more companies are considering the use of expert-system-based computerized maintenance programs, of the sort just mentioned. This article outlines several ways to establish such a program and examines the advantages and disadvantages of each. Subjects covered include maintenance problems handled by expert systems, types of expert systems, evaluation and selection guidelines, and others.

AB  - The use of methods of fuzzy mathematics for representation of knowledge in intelligent systems is considered. Properties of fuzzy numbers and relations as a basic apparatus for formalizing uncertain knowledge are discussed in detail. By using fuzzy modelling relations, a hierarchy of linguistic scales is developed for constructing a hierarchy of embedded fuzzy linguistic models of the external environment. A transition from a model of large dimensionality to a model of a smaller dimensionality allows computing time to be substantially reduced at the expense of decreasing the accuracy of the inference. The approach could be applied to expert systems of the production type.

AB  - The NASA/NBS Standard Reference Model (NASREM) Telerobot Control System Architecture has been adopted as the functional architecture for the FTS project. NASREM defines the basic architecture for a robot control system capable of teleoperation and autonomous operation. FTS is the first major project to adopt NASREM. The goal is to make it the standard for all robotic systems. The control system architecture is a three-legged hierarchy of computing modules, serviced by a communications system and a global memory. The first leg of the hierarchy plans and executes the decomposition of high level goals into low level actions. The second leg remembers, estimates, predicts, and evaluates the state of the world surrounding the telerobot. The third leg recognizes patterns, detects events, and filters and integrates sensory information.

AB  - Evolution toward more autonomy is part of the FTS design. The NASREM architecture with its standard interfaces permits development and evolution to greater autonomy. What is needed is technology that allows autonomous operation, a challenge being addressed at NASA's Goddard and Langley centers, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. NASA-Goddard has established a Development Integration and Test Facility where new technologies can be developed and applied to operational scenarios. Technologies in control strategies for an arm with seven DOF, including a safety system containing skin sensors for obstacle avoidance, are being developed. An important aspect of the development effort is to make orbital replacement units on scientific satellites 'robot friendly.' Robot compatibility is taken into consideration well in advance of final design. Robotics and structural engineers at Langley's Automated Structural Assembly Laboratory are investigating the possibility of using a robot to autonomously assemble space structures. Force/torque sensing and control methods have been used to enable the end effector to precisely insert one part into another, allowing the telerobot to perform automated assembly tasks on the space station.

AB  - Right-Writer by RightSoft and Grammatik III by Reference Software, will proofread documents created by most of the popular word processing programs. Both of these packages flag mistakes and allow the writer to correct them. These programs also return a report on the style and readability of the documents you create. Both programs present a number based on the Flesch formula for determining the readability of a document. This value is widely used by the insurance industry to rate the readability of their insurance policies. The Grammatik program uses Artificial Intelligence routines to determine the parts of speech for each word in your document. This is a process called 'parsing.' Once the program has determined the part of speech for each word, it compares the use of the word in the sentence to a style and usage guide. RightWriter, version 3.1, is a style and usage checker that is also intended for business and technical documents. The program requires 384K of RAM, two double density diskette drives or a hard drive and DOS version 2.0 or higher. The program comes on both 5.25 inch and 3.5 inch disks.

AB  - A new line of non-contact micrometers combines an optoelectronic system with circuitry that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze the optoelectronic system's output. The micrometers provide ultra-high accuracy and increased reliability at less than half the cost of similar instruments. Most of the cost savings result from the AI software's ability to compensate for small variations in an instrument's optoelectronic system.

AB  - Complex processing plants are operated (and for that matter designed) by individuals who cannot always envisage in sufficient detail the long range consequences of their current actions. Given that the desired outcome is the achievement of the overall process goals safely and efficiently, it is worthwhile considering the factors which may militate against the achievement of these aims and to how they might be avoided. This study describes methods which can be used to help develop safer and more efficient plant operation by the use of the computer to devise operating command sequences which achieve consecutive set of process goals subject of a variety of constraints (e.g. avoidance of unsafe states). The operating command sequences are required to be generated in the form of a sequence of valve operations. A catalyst-regeneration plant example originally devised by Rivas and Rudd (1975) is presented. (A)

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology. Research in AI is focused on developing computational approaches to intelligent behaviour. The computer programs with which AI could be associated are primarily symbolic processes associated with complexity, ambiguity, indecisiveness, and uncertainty. One of these computer programs is referred to as Knowledge-Based Expert System (KBES) as it represents knowledge acquired from various experts in a particular field of interest to the user. The expert system emulates human behaviour in solving problems thought to require experts for their solution by utilizing computer programs that incorporate experts' heuristic reasoning. In this paper, the application of KBES to aid the design of ball and roller bearings is discussed. The precision rolling-element bearing of the twentieth century is a product of exacting technology and sophisticated science. A bearing supports radial and axial loads, at the same time allowing relative motion between two elements of a machine. Various requirements and steps in the design of ball and roller bearings are discussed. Equations are developed for the relevant design parameters and input into the expert system shell called VP-Expert. The expert system rules are also provided. (A)

AB  - Neural Computing is one of the fastest growing areas of artificial intelligence. Neural nets are inherently parallel and as a result they can solve problems much faster than a serial digital computer. Neural nets have the ability to "learn". Rather than programming neural computers, one presents them with a series of examples and from these examples the net learns the governing relationships involved in the training database. This paper discusses the use of neural nets for modelling nonlinear chemical systems. Both a steady state reactor and a dynamic pH CSTR system are discussed. In both cases a backpropagation net successfully learns how to model the system. (A)

AB  - The importance of databases and data management in automated manufacturing and assembly systems is now well recognized in manufacturing science. Information, and its control, presents the integrating and coordinating influence on the system. Currently available database systems do not provide the capabilities desirable in future systems. A model for an information system in a manufacturing or assembly environment is presented. The object-oriented data model, artificial intelligence techniques and distributed database techniques are used in combination with other techniques. The model shows the potential to overcome some of the shortcomings of rational databases and the object-oriented data model. These shortcomings have appeared to block further developments in CIM (Computer Integrated Manufacturing) systems until now. (A)

AB  - This paper presents an application of symbolic computation in geometrical error modelling and simulation of an industrial robotic manipulator. A program named SCRPE (Symbolic Computation of Robot Pose Errors) has been developed to automatically generate error model equations for the end-eflector of N degree-of-freedom robots. The SCRPE utilizes symbolic manipulation capability of MACSYMA (a Lisp-base artificial intelligence language). The prime reasons of this work are to provide a base for comparison, performance assessment and accuracy judgment of numerous error calibration and compensation models available in the literature; and to represent output results in a concise form eliminating completely the manual derivation process. When such computer generated outputs are fed to a simulation program, saving in computational time for error estimation is realized. As an example, the mathematical error model considered here is based on small perturbation in link parameters defined in accordance with a classical Denavit-Hartenberg notation. The time required to compute first and second order terms of the model are compared for numerous robots. The worst case scenario takes 290 seconds for a PUMA 600 series robot, which is insignificant compared to the time required for accurate manual derivation. The SCRPE program is user-friendly, interactively menu-driven and has been developed on VAX 750 Digital computer under the VMS operating system.

AB  - American social scientists increasingly are writing and employing PC-based software to aid the development of social theories. This papar reviews several state-of-the-art software programs to demonstrate the current direction toward which American computer oriented social science theory is aimed. The first, INTERACT, uses mathematical equations to make predictions based on Affect Control Theory concerning changes in emotions and roles. Then I present two expert systems based on the more tarditional codification of knowledge. The first, PLACECON, is an experimental consulting system for placement of child welfare cases. The second, EX-SAMPLE, aids survey researchers routinize the decision-making process involved in statistical sampling. Typical expert systems rarely impress true experts. ETHNO, a boolean-based program with extremely wide applicability is helpful in systematizing the analysis of social interaction. It aids the qualitative researcher explicate necessary and sufficient conditions underlying the structure or dynamics of any chain of events or objects. The final example, SOAR, overcomes one of the greatest obstacles in all of the above programs. SOAR has the ability to deal with problems that arise when none of the program-built in rules apply and when many rules compete for application. In essence, it points the way for innovative ways to build and explore theory in ways not possible with more traditional computer programs. Â© 1990, Japanese Association For Mathematical Sociology.

AB  - A new test generation method is developed for digital systems on the basis of alternative graphs. Tests are generated using symbolic signal values and are organized in the compact way - in form of symbolic test programs and data arrays. A new architecture is proposed for test systems which is suited for on-line generating deterministic test patterns in algorithmic way. Special features are implemented in test generator and tester to support event driven testing, which makes it possible to test dynamically devices that work at higher clock rates than the tester does.

AB  - Drugs are administered to achieve a therapeutic objective. They can only be practically affected by controlling the manner in which they enter the body. In the open-loop control of drug response, optimization is based on calculations made by use of the pretreatment clinical parameters of the individual patent while in the closed-loop control of drug effect the observed characteristics and intensity of drug response are used to modify drug input according to the momentary need of the patient during therapy. Since the intensity and time patterns of the drug-elicited response are determined by the individual characteristics of the drug input-pharmacological response output relationship of the patient, mathematical models that describe this relationship can help to guide clinical therapy in a more rational way.

AB  - Both the quasicrystalline appearance of mammalian cerebral cortex and the quasiperiodicity of mammalian cerebral compound field potentials (EEG/ERBP) have long been noted. A recent experiment claims to show the eigenvalue spectrum of a quasiperiodic tiling of coupled oscillators in the plane; and this spectrum of resonant frequencies has some analogies with that of mammalian EEG/ERBP. Concurrently, Connec-tionist literature now admits the significance of internally generated network rhythmicity in Non-Lipschit-zian neurodynamics. It may be time to test the hypotheses of: (a) quasi-crystalline icosahedral symmetry of neocortical architectonics and (b) some fractal characteristics of EEG/ERBP under behavioral conditions.

AB  - Neural network modeling is approaching a strange attractor. Mathematical demonstrations of the theoretical behavior of non-Lipschitzian dynamical systems claim to show how such self-developing computational networks may be fully deterministic as to their microstructure yet without any prescription of their final state in advance. Justification for these simulations stems from applications which demand more biological realism in the design of neurobotics. Realization of such modeling in actual hardware does not exist. While the best of these models are surely heuristic for neuroscientists who want to know how brains work, their attempted realization in control systems for planetary high technology seems confounded by several intractable problems, which, a few years ago, would have interested only neurophilosophers in retirement.

AB  - Expert Systems are at work in a variety of technical and managerial applications. Using custom designed knowledge bases and decision rules, expert systems prompt the user to explain a problem and then offer solutions or advice on how to proceed to solve the problem. A properly designed expert system maximizes the virtues of human experts by emphasizing performance and reliability, by being easy to use, by being able to explain its advice and entire line of reasoning and by being capable of interfacing with other computer systems and databases. This paper surveys the development of expert systems and offers a discussion of some aspects of expert system design and introduction. The paper concludes with a review of Navy logistics expert systems now in design. Â© 1990 by the American Society of Naval Engineers

AB  - As the interest to practical applications of expert systems increases, the necessity of formulating a well defined approach to their development becomes indisputable. In this paper we present a methodology whose aim is to establish the suitability of the expert systems to provide effective and efficient solution to a certain problem. The methodology is based on the top-down approach and constrains the developer to perform certain activities in a prefixed order. During the various steps of the methodology, a set of forms is produced, in order to allow both the gathering of the information and construction 'by the way' of the final evaluation. Experimental results in applying the methodology to a real world case study are also reported. Â© 1990.

AB  - The paper represents new generation of star trackers for astroorientation of satellites of the SPECTR series, i.e. the carriers of scientific payloads within the framework of the Intercosmos program. The system is designed for the new X-ray orbiting observatory SPECTR - RENTGEN - GAMMA. The architecture and the implementation of certain blocks of the intelligent astronavigation system are described. It is based on CCD sensors for obtaining images from point and extended optical sources. The implementation of digital image processing and the identification of observed stellar configuration into the onboard stellar catalog make the system entirely autonomous. The automatic identification and the flexible system control ensure work without preliminary instructions and refer the system to new generation sensors with artificial intelligence. The system works in the following modes: &#x02022; - tracking of point sorces; &#x02022; - tracking of extended sources; &#x02022; - optical navigation. This system can be used for both three axial stabilization and spinrotating satellites. The modular principle of the system, the availability of image processing and recognition, the onboard catalog memory and the operational modes of the system define it as multifunctional one and enable its adaptation to robotic identification and positioning vision technology for space station applications.

AB  - For many hybrid manufacturers, diagnosis and repair of hybrids is primarily a manual process. Technicians isolate faults by relying on a tester's failure messages, the circuit's schematic, and their own knowledge of electronic circuitry. The automated model-based troubleshooting system offers significant advantages over manual troubleshooting including higher accuracy, faster fault isolation time, and documentation of pertinent design and test information. The requirements needed for good manual troubleshooting have been incorporated into a new model-based troubleshooting system called ELECTRA. This system primarily is aimed at the troubleshooting of analog and mixed-signal hydrids and PCBs. The ELECTRA system is discussed.

AB  - Theoretical and conceptual constructs for the design of a specification language that generates intelligent discrete next-event simulations is presented. Such a specification language would facilitate rapid prototyping of discrete simulation models. The language enforces a rigorous, disciplined approach to formulation of simulation models. The language documents and stores each software component so that it could be reused. Critical to the definition of such a language is the creation of a universal set of icon primitives and a collection of grammar rules for concatenation of primitives into 'words'.

AB  - Expert systems provide a means to capture the expertise of individuals who have many years of experience on a particular job, and they have the potential of becoming a complete knowledge source. If the knowledge of one expert is insufficient to handle the problem, it can be improved over time by the addition of knowledge from other experts or additional findings. Expert systems can also be used to free up the time of experts and other employees so they can concentrate on other more important tasks. There will be significant opportunities to apply expert systems in manufacturing to automate, to reduce costs, and to improve bottom line performance. While it is unlikely that expert systems will replace the need for human resources, their use in facilitating POM functions seems assured.

AB  - A new model is introduced for avoiding accidents where a tugboat capsizes or trips when towing a larger vessel. The development of the Tripping Avoidance Knowledge Base (TAKB) is described in terms of the relevant descriptive parameters, the graphical representation of the knowledge base and its conversion to a decision matrix is also shown. As with any AI application in a new and promising area, there are many unclear points which this paper highlights. The paper closes with the authors' recommendations for future development and refinement of the knowledge base. Â© 1990 by the American Society of Naval Engineers

AB  - The use of smart sensors in decentralized control to provide greater protection from disruption of process plants is discussed. Beacuse of the range of non-compatible smart sensors now available, a single European communications standard 'field bus' is being developed. Increased competition between the bigger companies and with many Japanese companies has persuaded many process companies to delay before buying systems to benefit from lower proces, improved and standardized products.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved within the past decades from a laboratory and exploratory endeavour to a quantitative science. The maturation is visible in numerous applications of AI, especially expert systems, to industry. Machine Learning, an area of AI that focusses on learning and self-improvement of software systems, has had a number of successes. These successes have been the reason for the rise of machine learning and its application to different problems in complex industrial domains. This article is a summary of a project to use machine learning for problems in industrial planning and decision making. (A)

AB  - In this article some problems are given which accompany time series forecasting for a maximum demand optimization of electric energy. Two complexly developed methods (Box-Jenkins and Zadeh-Ragazzini) for saving this problem are presented in a very concise form. A new method for time series forecasting, which depends on artificial intelligence methods, is described.
