AB  - This presentation outlines some of the uses made by Chinese doctors of computer aided systems for decision support in relation to clinical medical problems. Such systems have proved of practical value in China. The results in several areas (notably gastro-intestinal cancer detection) have proved similar to those in Western studies. Various mathematical models have been employed - none emerging as superior in all areas. Finally it is suggested that traditional Chinese medicine may be an interesting area in which to explore the problems and prospects of artificial intelligence.

AB  - The combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Aided Design is a trend in computer aided techniques. In this paper, we discuss some AI techniques used in special CAD systems developed at Zhangjiang University. First, an expert system used in art pattern CAD is presented. Accessing the knowledge bases, the expert system reasons to produce various kinds of pseudo-3D art patterns which can be used for textile such as cotton, silk, and carpet. We shall focus on its knowledge representation and fuzzy reasoning mechanism. In the second part of the paper, a geometric modelling system for architectural CAD is described; and in particular, a method to construct the hierarchical geometry model of complex scene environment is introduced. The method is based on the clustering technique of Pattern Recognition. The geometric modelling system can build the hierarchical 3D geometric model automatically and the efficiency of the system is obviously improved with the method. © 1987.

AB  - Heuristics is an important characteristic of human thinking; an experience-based methodology by which humans manipulate the objective world. The authors suggest that heuristic knowledge can also be expressed, under certain conditions, in terms of mathematical formulae. In the paper, a novel idea is proposed, in which a heuristic methodology is used to search for a control sequence which will cause a controlled process to have an ideal output. By means of a Least Square Fit, a set of data from heuristic control can be fitted to a control law, such as a PID. Two examples of finding such control laws are given. The idea of combining artificial intelligence with conventional control may assist the development of intelligent control. © 1988.

AB  - We present a model-based remotely-sensed image interpretation expert system embeded in a knowledge-based geographic information system (KBIS). The KBIS consists of four sub-systems: a pictorial data base system, an image interpretation expert system, a computer-aided planning system and a computer-aided cartographic system. The image interpretation expert system represents ecological knowledge and other expert knowledge by frames. Its reasoning process consists of a forward reasoning based on the Bayes classification of Landsat imagery, a backward reasoning using frame knowledge and reasoning using a spatial consistency model. A forest inventory study was conducted in Shaxian county, in the southern part of China, using this expert system. The results have shown a significant improvement. Building image interpretation expert systems within knowledge-based pictorial systems is very convenient and efficient because there are well-organized data, knowledge and procedures available. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - An expert system operated in a personal computer is employed to simulate chemistry and sorption phenomena of radionuclides in the geosphere. The system handles both qualitative and quantitative analyses primarily for the actinides and fission products. The system also incorporates data bases of several groundwater and rock types with mineral and chemical compositions, the distribution coefficients of nuclides for minerals, etc. The decision rule base facilitates this system to carry out the reasoning procedures to predict the solubility-limiting phase, solute species, oxidation states and possible complex formations of radionuclides, as well as to calculate the distribution coefficients and retardation factors in a geological formation, provided that the essential groundwater and host rock information are available. It is concluded that this device of artificial intelligence provides a vehicle to accumulate developed human knowledge and serves as a tool not only for simulating the complicated radionuclide behaviour in the geosphere, but also for instructional or educational purpose in this field. © R.

AB  - Combining knowledge engineering technology with some operations research algorithms will get novel efficient optimization methods. As an example, this paper discusses a knowledge-based successive linear programming method for linearly constrained optimization problems. In this new method we use both traditional successive linear programming algorithm in operations research and the knowledge base which is constructed with the expertise of an optimization expert and valuable experience data, so that this knowledge-based program can solve optimization problems somewhat like a human expert who is great at operations research and has a lot of practical experience of problem-solving. The improvement of efficiency in problem-solving depends mainly on the skilful use of plausible reasoning based on incomplete experience knowledge. In addition, man-machine interaction during the computation procedures is also used. Finally, two numerical examples illustrate that the proposed method is much more flexible and efficient than the traditional operations research algorithms concerned. © 1988, Academic Press Limited.

AB  - The goal of knowledge clustering is that acquired knowledge is divided into several classes according to some principles and the knowledge in an identical class should have some general features on the concepts of classifying attributes so as to overcome some disadvantages produced by the centralized store of knowledge and to raise the working efficiency of a knowledge base. This paper describes a goal-oriented conceptual clustering method in the course of acquiring knowledge in a real-time production command system. This method makes use of background knowledge, concept attributes of knowledge, and clustering goals in a clustering knowledge base to infer clustering attributes of knowledge. The paper also discusses the components of a clustering algorithm model base and a clustering process. © 1990.

AB  - A knowledge-based system for aiding in the construction of practical heat exchanger networks called SPHEN is presented in this article. The created network configurations feature low utility cost, low capital investment, rather stable heat recovery during operation and rational distribution of pressure drops among the network branches. SPHEN consists of four component parts: network construction, simulator, flowsheet diagram generation and user's feedback subsystem. So SPHEN is characterized by its hybridity, reflected in knowledge representation and abstraction,solving methods and implementation languages. The hybrid system is implemented through disk files and data files connecting different parts into one working space. An example of redesigning an energy recovery network of a large-scale crude oil unit is illustrated and the results obtained are successful. © 1989.

AB  - The chemical databases available in China may be roughly classified into four categories with respect to their coverage: engineering chemistry database, spectroscopic database, fundamental database, and bibliographic database as well. Some of the databases cited are here briefly discussed. The NEDB, Non-electrolyte V-L Equilibrium Database data file is composed of 750 organic compounds, 1 996 activity coefficient model parameters, 189 242 Vapor-Liquid equilibrium experimental data, 1 296 functional group parameters as well as 21 activity coefficient models. Fundamental thermodynamic data of 879 ions and 287 molecules in solution are covered in ATDB, (Aqueous Solution Thermodynamic Database). With the help of ATDB, users can successfully undertake a series of complicated thermodynamic tasks for the system of ions, molecules or complex aqueous solutions. Spectroscopic databases are constructed by the co-work of many scientists and involve mass spectra, infrared spectra, carbon-13 NMR spectra and Electronic Spectra for Chemical Analysis (ESCA). Toxicity Database deals mainly with chemical names, structures, toxicity data and its reference information for more than 70 000 chemicals imported from the USA. The applications of artificial intelligence are also discussed.

AB  - The system-energy-conservation technique (SECT) which is different from the traditional energy conservation technique (TECT) in methodology, widens the field of energy conservation research. The enterprise energy model, the backbone of SECT, is a combination of process modelling, optimization for large scale system, and computer techniques and is an effective means of computer-aided decision-making for production planning and energy management. In the future one of the major trends of energy saving will be the application of artificial intelligence and data processing.

AB  - A new model of robot vision system built on the knowledge base is under development. The main idea is unifying techniques of AND/OR tree reduction, semantic network and Minsky frame into a coordinative representation of knowledge about environment. The descriptions of a scene are generated, as a fact base, in real time from the raw image. Beside, an inference engine will run the whole system into active states. As a result, the inferred knowledge is obtained, and used for robot's decision making and action planning. Several experiments proved that the system can understand and interpret any preassigned scene and its varieties.

AB  - Considerable attention has been focused recently upon effective extraction and encoding of the knowledge of experts. This is a well-known basic problem of Artificial Intelligence. By combining the advantages of AHP (the Analytic Hierarchy Process1) with statistical analysis, a new method (PC-AHP) had been devised and is presented in this paper. In evaluating a multi-layer, multi-criterion system, a consistency adjuster is used in the PC-AHP method, to avoid tedious consistency checks. The method is demonstrated in an application evaluating the comprehensive development of cities. It is shown to have improved synthesis functions, and to be capable of flexible operation. © 1990.

AB  - The ability to learn is one of the most essential characteristics of human intelligent behaviour. For many decades, learning has attracted the interest of many researchers, and therefore, the fields concerned with the developing computational theories of learning processes and building learning machines are central to the progress of artificial intelligence. In this paper, we will discuss the structure of the attribute set and present an attribute theory for machine learning. In order to explain the functions we will give an algorithm AL for learning by analogy based on attribute theory. © 1990.

AB  - A paradigm of program development using type theories is given after analyzing some typical examples. In order to carry this approach forward, a language ALT is designed, a linguistic description of a generalized higher order typed lambda calculus with Π, Σ types and Π, Σ kinds (supertype). Four examples are given to show how ALT can be used to implement many concepts of software engineering and artificial intelligence, they are intuitionistic logic, Peano arithmetic, approximate reasoning and program transformation. ALT is described formally, using a structural operational approach. © 1990.

AB  - By functional analysis, a generalized operator equation is devised to discribe almost all the boundary value problems of various physical disciplines such as electrodynamics, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics etc. From the generalized operator equation is developed a unique unified boundary integral equation which represents almost all the boundary integral equations of various physical disciplines. From the unified boundary integral equation, by discretization, follows a unique unified boundary element equation which represents almost all the boundary element equations of various physical disciplines.A number of practical examples in electrodynamics, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics and thermodynamics are worked out in detail to exhibit the powerful tool of the unified theory which is necessary for studying various physical disciplines by BEM systematically and for developing the expert system of BEM. © 1990, IEEE.

AB  - Since the seventies, many research papers on Multiobjective Decision Making (MODM) have centered around three MODM methods: (1) Generation of Noninferior Solutions, (2) Priori Preference, and (3) Progressive Articulation of Preference. These three methods all suffer from the following shortcoming: in the process of finding solutions, some information is either neglected or biased by personal preference. The elimination of such a shortcoming is the aim of this paper. In this paper, the information required for solving problems is processed into intelligence information by means of knowledge engineering. This paper emphasizes the role of knowledge and experience. Through formalization, the specialized knowledge of a particular field - including both the relevant theoretical knowledge and the viewpoints and judgements of experts - is stored in a knowledge base. Combining MODM with such as established knowledge system makes problem solutions more effective. Even ill-structured problems, unsolvable with conventional three MODM methods, can be dealt with. Furthermore, the decision-making process becomes more transparent and flexible than that of the conventional three MODM methods. The above is essentially a significant improvement on the conventional method of priori preference: establishing an intelligence system to assign priority of objectives and treating priori preference structure as an intelligence structure. It is believed that the author is the first to propose such an improvement. The above improvement has proved preliminarily successful when applied to decision making and planning in business management. By applying knowledge engineering to MODM, this paper indicates it is possible to introduce artificial intelligence into MODM research.

AB  - As for the condition prediction and operation control of blast furnace process, a hybrid expert system of the ingenious combination of automatic control with artificial intelligence is developed in the paper. The feature of this expert system is that in predicting and controlling, there are not only the experience of operators for guiding but also the control model for executing. The knowledge of the most excellent operator is represented in the manner of meta-knowledge level and comprehensive-knowledge level, which composes of sensor information judgement, interim judgement, final judgement and action stages. A Knowledge model based on rule sets reflects overall the knowledge. The modification to the weight coefficients of the knowledge model is performed by means of an adaptive identification algorithm. The expert system with adaptive function is testingly applied to No.1 blast furnace at Baoshan Iron and Steel Co. and the blast furnace is stably operated. © 1992.

AB  - An AI-aided simulation system embedded in a model-based, aspiration-led decision support system NY-IEDSS is reported. The NY-IEDSS is designed for mid-term development strategic study of the Nanyang Region in Henan, China, and is getting beyond its prototype stage under the decision maker's (the end user) orientation. The integration of simulation model system, decision analysis and expert system for decision support in the system implementation was reviewed. The intent of the paper is to provide insight as to how system capability and acceptability can be enhanced by this integration. Moreover, emphasis is placed on problem orientation in applying the method.

AB  - An automatic understanding system MAD-READER based on the techniques of image processing, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence has been developed for mechanical engineering drawings. The principles of the system are presented, which include the methods and techniques of recognition and understanding for topological assembly drawings (TAD). A rule-based generator GEN-PLAN is devised to generate directly assembly plans from TAD assembly drawings. A variety of TAD assembly drawings has been used for testing the generator. So far, GEN-PLAN has been used to recognize TAD assembly drawings which consist of 31 part symbols, and generate their assembly plans. The present generator has shown favorable results. © 1991 Chapman and Hall Ltd.

AB  - Geometry modelling is the key step of CAD/CAM. The modelling system of mechanical parts must include information of many aspects for design and manufacture processes apart from those of geometric configuration. Six features, with the form feature as the leading one, are used to describe parts. The authors develope FEATMD, a modelling system based on these features. It consists of 8 modules and 2 databases, and is written in 'C' language. The creation and management of the form feature database based on frame description are presented first. Parts modelling process and information transformation in FEATMD are discussed in details. Reasoning on frame network enables the CAD information transfer into the CAM environment.

AB  - A new subset selection algorithm is proposed, based on artificial intelligence search techniques. It selects the globally best subset with the optimal size from an element set without exhaustive enumeration. Existing procedures either do not guarantee the optimality of the selected subset or do not determine optimal subset size. Exhaustive searches, on the other hand, are generally computationally unfeasible. The adoptability of the present algorithm is proved. The experiments, in the applications of the algorithm to clustering and feature selection, show its effectiveness. © 1992.

AB  - Expert system for prognosis of acute myocardial-infarction(AMI) was established based on statistic analysis of data base of AMI Cases, reference expert experiences and indices intimately related with AMI prognosis. Using fuzzy probability method, suggested a concept of risk degree and studied the relationship between the indices and prognosis. Summarized the AMI clincal course and experience of diagnosis and cure, under the guidance of artificial intelligence. Using qualitative and quantitative data analyses in combination with fuzzy set and mathematical logic methods, built an expert system for estimation of state of patient in acute stage of AMI from clinical data within five days of disease in order to find out main factors influencing prognosis and provide proper treatment. The rate of correct diagnosis was more than 90% using the expert system. Characteristics and practical value of the method were also discussed.

AB  - An intelligent system which consists of a microcomputer, either APPLE II or TRS-80, associated with a hardware interface card and system-driving software was established for potentiometric analysis. It can perform pH measurements with automatic calibration of pH electrodes, temperature compensation (0-95°C) and pH titrations, ionic activity measurements, with twelve determination and computation methods and automatic calibration of ion-selective electrodes and mV measurements with multi-point calibration of electrodes and the function of automatically linking the user's own programs into the intelligent system. Data from eight channels can be collected simultaneously, and various experimental operations are managed and controlled interactively through the system-driving software programmed in Assembly-BASIC language in modular blocks. Many fault-finding "trappers" are included in the software to avoid wrong actions during experiments. The system is arranged to be compact and easily expanded by modifications of relative hardware interface circuitry and revisions of the software concerned. With the features of BASIC language programming and the user's programs automatically linked, it can be routinely used as a potentiometric analysis and developing system relying on ion-selective electrodes, biosensors and enzyme sensors. © 1992.

AB  - Fuzzy mathematics and fuzzy logic have wide applications in many scientific research areas like artificial intelligence, pattern recognition and automatic control, etc. It is also a necessary tool in studying optical artificial intelligence and optical neural networks. A new design of optical fuzzy logic gates using simple optoelectronic hybrid circuits is presented in this paper. Four basic fuzzy logic implementations, such as complement, maximum, minimum and bounded difference are demonstrated experimentally. A multifunctional programmable optoelectronic hybrid fuzzy logic gate is also proposed. Different input assignment can be chosen by employing a multiplex logic circuit, and therefore seven kinds of fundamental fuzzy logic implementations include bounded sum, bounded product and implication can be performed in real time.

AB  - The authors introduced a practical expert system called Cylindrical Gear Reducer Design Expert System (CGREST), which was a CAD sub-project regarding heavy-duty machinery elementary parts in the seventh 5-year National Economic Plain of China. The system was developed by using principles of artificial intelligence and expert system to solve special design problem. In exploring and investigating the theoretical and practical techniques relating to designing CGRST, new attempts were made in the aspects concerning design ideas, implementation strategies, knowledge acquisition and representation, knowledge control and inference, also in imitating the thought of human designers, mechanical designing and drawing. Main constructural parts of the CGREST was described and satisfactory results were obtained.

AB  - - This paper presents a novel fuzzy logic controller for use in the fully digital speed control of ac servo systems. A new intelligent inverter is also proposed to reduce the switching loss and the current harmonics in induction motors. A 16-bit single-chip microprocessor is used to reduce the number of circuit components for cost reduction and reliability enhancement. In order to facilitate the instantaneous control of motor torque, indirect field orientation is adopted along with a current regulated pulse-width-modulation voltage-source inverter (CRPWM VSI). Computer simulation is first given to assess the feasibility of the system proposed. Circuit design and software development are then undertaken. Simulation results are verified experimentally. © 1993 IEEE

AB  - The paper presents the conceptual and operational basis of the creation of IDSS based on our recent research experience. In this paper, an intelligent decision support system, IDSS is defined as: any interactive system that is specially designed to improve the decision making of its user by extending the user's cognitive decision making abilities. As a result, this view of man-machine joint cognitive system stresses the need to use computational technology to aid the user in the decision making process. And the human's role is to achieve total systems's objectives. The paper outlines the designing procedure in successive steps. First, the decision maker's cognitive needs for decision support are identified. Second, the computationally realizable support functions are defined that could be provided by IDSS. Then, the specific techniques that would best fill the decision needs are discussed. And finally, for system implementation the modern computational technology infrastructure is emphasized.

AB  - This paper addresses the topic of automatic fault tree construction, utilizing an expert system with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and presents the related software tool, TREE-EXPERT-an expert system for automatic fault tree construction. In the light of the features involved in developing a fault tree, a new and more reasonable structure of knowledge representation, which is knowledge tree based, has been established. The knowledge tree provides the means by which component failure behaviors can be described by a group of particular fault tree modules instead of production rules. By introducing the conditional branch function, the new design of the knowledge base incorporates many good features such as strong expressivity, flexibility and ease of extension and it takes advantage of the user's familiarity with the field of fault tree analysis. Additionally, the design of the inference engine is original in that it deals with nodes, which it treats, as special components, so that many complicated engineering cases, such as the application of success criteria, and the problems of flow diversions and flow reversals in a process system, can be well managed and the function of the expert system is improved as a whole. TREE-EXPERT can be used to deal with large-scale and complicated engineering systems, and many engineering factors can be considered, e.g. more than one system parameter and the effect on them switching of the system operating states, bi-directional inference, human error failure, common-cause failure, maintenance and test, etc. On the other hand, the software uses P & ID (Pipe & Instrument Diagram) type interface to describe the system topology, which provides an easier man-machine interface with powerful graphics functions. This software can handle not only 'process' systems but also, with appropriate additions to the generic knowledge base, electrical systems and other similar systems. © 1993.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to describe how AI (artificial intelligence) and fuzzy logic techniques can be combined to implement an on-line computer control of an axial gear-shaving process in order to improve the quality of workpiece gears. The basic principle of correcting the geometric errors of workpiece gears is introduced. The final knowledge base is obtained by the iterative procedure of trying the expert controller, observing the results and then modifying the control rules accordingly. Inference is provided by a fuzzy logic engine. Experimental results showed that accuracy of the shaved gears was greatly enhanced. The total cumulative pitch error arid the individual pitch error were reduced by approximately two times. In particular, the flank grooves, which commonly occur in the middle of tooth profiles, were removed. © 1993, Institution of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.

AB  - With artificial intelligence technology in searching, Xu, et al. presented a global optimum feature selection algorithm, BF (Best-First), which is computationally superior to that of BB (Branch and Bound). Based on the analysis of search tree TB used in BF, this paper proposed a new structure of search tree, Tb, on which there are fewer nodes than that on TB. A feature selection algorithm on Tb, referred as to BF', was designed, of which the computational complexity is lower than that of BF, without increasing storage and with global optimum property.

AB  - This paper proposes a new neural network model UMAN to perform unsupervised image segmentation. In the neural network, the generalized information entropy is used as the quantitative description and measurement of the system stability and asymptotication, and the disadvantage of generalized energy function is avoided. The improved Kohonen non-linear mapping structure not only contrasts the clustering features, but also reduces the redundant information. In the network, the internal layer and node numbers are determined dynamically by the system. The interaction and a prior knowledge are not required. The unsupervised self-learning function expresses the characteristics of the low-level visual information processing. The UMAN model can process various types of images and has strong adaptability. Experimental results show that the model and its algorithm are efficient, practical and robust.

AB  - Optical implementation methods of one dimensional LINN(local interconnection neural network) for associative memory were proposed. Three optoelectronic systems including the multi-imaging system, the incoherent correlation system and the overlapping system were discussed. Based on the optical incoherent correlation system, experimental results of one dimensional LINN were obtained by using image monitor to encode interconnection weight matrix and liquid crystal displayer to encode the input vector. With little modification, the optical system used for implementation of Hopfield model can be employed for implementation of local interconnection associative memory. And because of the small size of local interconnection weight matrix, it is possible to implement a large scale neural network system by using the spatial light modulators available.

AB  - A novel network based on the Hopfield neural network to handle the four-coloring map problem is presented. The structure of this network is simple, regular, and fault-tolerant. The network can be implemented with electronic circuits. The correct outputs can be obtained when the external excitations to neurons or the inter-connecting weights are slightly different. Two different approaches are used to simulate the performance of the network. The results are in accord with theoretical analysis.

AB  - Reflective programming languages were introduced in order to study programs that need knowledge of their own behavior. In artificial intelligence, this kind of knowledge is heeded, for example, in programs that must explain their behavior to a user. In the study of programming languages, a similar phenomenon occurs in extensible languages, that is, languages in which one can write programs that change the language itself. In this paper, we present an investigation of computational reflection mechanism in a higher-order &lambda;-calculus - PowerEpsilon. We will show that PowerEpsilon is an extremely rich and powerful language for reflective computation. © 1994, ACM. All rights reserved.

AB  - The techniques of artificial intelligence have been widely used in many areas, including reliability engineering and system safety, e.g. the expert systems for fault diagnoses of complex engineering systems. Uncertainties are an important issue to be addressed in these techniques. This paper presents a methodology dealing with the probabilistic reasoning under uncertainty in artificial intelligence systems. This methodology is based on the newly defined causality trees/diagrams that can be either singly or multiply connected; moreover, it can include causality loops. Two new kinds of events, basic events and linkage events, are introduced. Their probabilities of occurrence are easily obtained from subjective belief or statistics, and are independent of each other. Thus, they are modular and deliverable as a part of knowledge. Also, the causality trees/diagrams can include on-line dynamical information. Two equivalent belief updating approaches are presented which operate regardless of whether the target system is singly connected, multiply connected or causally looped. Two examples are given to illustrate and prove this methodology. © 1995.

AB  - This paper presents the structure and design criteria of a neural network-based multimedia information processing and analysis system (MIPAS) which can be used to deal with more-complicated intelligence issues. According to the structure and design criteria, a software environment (SEMIPAS), which supports the implementation of multimedia information (image + speech, image + characters, speech + characters, image + speech + characters) processing and analysis applications, is implemented and introduced. Under this software environment, a multimedia information processing and analysis system called "To Know the World" is constructed. Experiments show that the multimedia information processing and analysis is much more powerful and effective than single-medium information processing and analysis. © 1994.

AB  - The framework of the case-based decision support system (CBDSS) is introduced to allow people to resort to the valuable cases in similar decision environments with computer-based decision support systems. A CBDSS shell is developed which consists mainly of a problem analyser, a case base, a knowledgebase, a learning engine and an inference engine. The artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to draw knowlege from verified cases. A prototype of a CBDSS generated from the shell for failure analysis of metal parts is established and the experimental results presented. © 1994.

AB  - We present a simple framework, called computational network, for formalizing river networks to provide a computer-based solution to problems of simulating concentrations of water quality constituents in river networks. The method was applied on a river network in Beijing-Tianjin area. The framework is developed by an object-oriented approach integrating the modelling of the static structure of river networks with that of the dynamic behavior of water quality constituents in them. Similar to artificial neural networks, computational networks can be used for learning, problem solving and controlling. © 1994.

AB  - Brewka's Cumulative Default Logic (CDL), a new version of Reiter's default logic, puts emphasis on the joint consistency among the justifications of all applied defaults to obtain cumulativity. In this paper, a finite characterization of CDL extensions using sets of generating defaults is given. From this characterization we derive new algorithms for various reasoning tasks in CDL. Moreover, we show that (propositional) cumulative default reasoning has the same complexity as classical default reasoning. © 1994.

AB  - A verification system for real-time programs must provide a means of showing that the programs are logically correct and of proving that all timing constraints are met. To prove a program correct, according to traditional methods, all possible execution sequences (i.e. traces) must be shown to satisfy the specifications. That, however, will lead to the exponential explosion of the traces. This paper adopts an Artificial Intelligence technique to verify real-time programs, and proposes a method by which the real-time programs are proved just in a so-called "Reasonable Trace Space" (RTS). The RTS is a subset of the set of all traces (in short, the ATS) and is determined by a knowledge base which is provided by the program designer or a software verification expert. If a real-time program is proved correct in the RTS (which is much smaller than the ATS), it can be concluded that it is error free in the sense of the knowledge base. A knowledge-based trace-generation algorithm which enumerates all reasonable traces and a trace-verification algorithm which decides whether a trace is correct or not, are presented. Their performances are also analyzed. © 1994.

N1  - Funding text 1: A real-time system is one in which system activities have to be completed before a certain deadline. When such a system is implemented as a distributed system, these activities are performed in different processors (nodes), they depend on each other and communicate via a channel or a medium. In automatic real-time (embedded) control systems and local area computer networks, there are many real-time programs. This kind of software is often installed in a device to control some components or elements of the device. Because of the embedded properties, the embedded software Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeast University, 110006 Shenyang, P. R.

AB  - Reiter and de Kleer have independently developed a theory of diagnosis from first principles. Reiter's approach to computing all diagnoses for a given faulty system is based upon the computation of all minimal hitting sets for the collection of conflict sets for (sd,components,obs). Unfortunately, his theory does not include a theory of measurement. De Kleer and Williams have developed GDE-general diagnostic engine. Their procedure computes all minimal conflict sets resulting from a measurement before discriminating the candidate space. However, they do not provide a formal justification for their theory. We propose a general theory of measurement in diagnosis and provide a formal justification for our theory. Several novel contributions make up the central focus of this paper. First, this work provides an efficient incremental method for computing new diagnoses given a new measurement, based on the previous diagnoses predicting the opposite. Second, this work defines the concepts of conflict set resulting from a measurement, equivalence classes and homogeneous diagnoses as the basis of the method. Finally, this work leads to a procedure for computing all diagnoses and discriminating among competing diagnoses resulting from a measurement. © 1994.

AB  - Flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) are designed to produce a variety of different part types with high machine utilisation, so the maintenance technique is necessary and very important in an FMS. This paper discusses the maintenance problem in an FMS and its simulation, analyses the maintainability of a real FMS shop, and presents the architecture of an integrated system of maintenance and decision-making/scheduling for manufacturing shop control. The modelling and simulation of the maintenance activities in the shop are shown. The simulation program is written in SLAM II and the special subroutines are realised in Fortran. The interest is directed towards the use of the method of simulation for maintenance and decision-making in FMSs. © 1994 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

AB  - The pattern recognition and neural network methods were used to investigate the formability of metastable alloy phases. It was found that some chemical bond parameters such as valence electron number, electronegativity and metallic radii of component elements are the dominating factors affecting metastable alloy phase formation. Some semi-empirical rules found in this way may be useful for the construction of expert systems for materials design.

AB  - In this paper, a polynomial approximation method and theory were introduced into the research of learning search of artificial intelligence. In this way, the learning search can construct a heuristic estimate function h(.) which uniformly approximates to the optimal estimate function h*(.) with arbitrarily high precision through repeated solution. One of such learning search algorithms, A-Bn, was presented and it was proved that when the training sample set becomes large enough, the worst-case complexity of A-Bn can be reduced to O(poly(N)), where N is the length of the optimal solution path, and poly(N) is a polynomial of N.

AB  - This paper proposed a new method for the realtime topology analysis on power systems, which is based on the representation and inference techniques of artificial intelligence. The representation of electric network configuration is symbolized, so the conventional manual procedure to number equipment terminals is eliminated, and many tables related to the power system connectivity are not necessary. Thus this method is simple and efficient in writing and debugging the programme to determine the network topology. It has been successfully applied to the expert system for power systems restoration. Furthermore, a simplified algorithm for overloads relief was presented, which is based on the decoupling of active and reactive optimal power flow corrections. It can solve the overload problem in loop power systems efficiently with less computer memory.

AB  - Production systems, also called rule-based systems, are an important artificial intelligence (AI) programming language, but it is hard to be applied in real-time field. Based on the analysis of the two major deficiencies (low execution rate and insensitive to asynchronous external events) in production systems for real-time applications, several possible approaches and methods to realizing real-time production system were investigated.

AB  - Intelligent control is aiming to solve the task-oriented (goal seeking) control problems in complex environments which are unstructural, uncertain and have strong interactions with the object to be controlled. Traditional artificial intelligence (AI) approach with emphasis on symbolic processing the logic reasoning has been confronted with serious difficulties in action oriented tasks, however, studying of new techniques for modelling and recognition of complex environments by mathematically precise ways and development of design techniques for imprecisely defined environments and tasks based on ideas in the newly emerging schools of AI may be integrated to provide new schemes and architectures for intelligent controls. It was anticipated that significant breakthrough would occur when the research following the top-down lines intersects with those following the bottom-up lines.

AB  - A new definition of similarity for the bipolar WTA (Winner-Take-All) neural network model and its implementation were presented. A threshold is added to the system for distinguishing input patterns that are none of the memory patterns or do not have enough information to be recognized. The threshold value is related to the requirement of error tolerance. The experimental system and experimental results were introduced. It was indicated theoretically and experimentally that the modified bipolar WTA neural network model has stronger storage and addressing capacity, and it can realize both self-association and inter-association. In addition, the WTA model can be implemented not only by coherent technique, but also by incoherent technique.

AB  - Binary serial-coded-filters were designed based on the optimization function of the Hopfield model. Compared with other methods, this method needs less filters to carry out the same recognition task. A computer simulation has been conducted with this method. The 26 English letters were used as the target objects. The simulation results were presented and discussed. It was demonstrated that this method has very strong error-tolerant capacity, all target objects can be correctly recognized when the characteristic codes are properly chosen. The characteristic codes have some influence on the storage and error-tolerant capacity of the filter.

AB  - In the pulsed GMAW, the behaviour of droplet transfer is a predominant parameter for maintaining process stability and ensuring weld quality. As of yet, but a direct close-loop droplet transfer control system for the pulsed GMAW has not been developed. Based on the study of the correlation between droplet transfer and arc light radiant flux in GMAW of steel and aluminum, a direct close-loop droplet transfer control system for the pulsed GMAW of steel and aluminum alloy with the arc light sensor has been developed. By sensing the droplet transfer directly via the are light signal, a pulsed GMAW process of steel and aluminum with exact one droplet per pulse transfer has been created. The capacity of droplet transfer control of this system has been verified by high-speed photography. The welding process is proved to be quiet, stable, spatter-free and of uniform weld formation. This control system may be a development of a new generation of artificial intelligence welding systems.

AB  - This paper presents a sensor failure detection method with artificial neural network for critical complex equipments, where their dynamic performance usually can not be actually obtained. However, if the number of measured variables is higher than the order of the system, using the inherent redundant relationship among sensors, we can detect the sensor failure and even recover or estimate the correct readings of the failed sensor. Two kinds of artificial neural network were trained to accomplish these aims, one is used to detect the sensor failure and the other is applied to recover the readings of failed sensor. The feasibility of this method was proved with computer simulation through a mathematic model of an automotive engine in a hovercraft.

AB  - This paper is concerned with building a model of Artificial Neural Network Predictor (ANP) for the self-tuning adaptive system. The learning algorithm of ANN is proposed accompanying with the analysis of its control strategy. Here, it could perhaps provide the active idea to solve such difficulty problem that is about how to use self-tuning algorithm to control the non-linear, complicated system. The results have demonstrated that use of ANP in self-tuning control can provide the better performance than can be achieved using the general strategy.

AB  - For the dynamic property in the control system, in this paper we advance dynamic logic to analyze and synthesize the control problems. This approach is similar to the way in which people always resolve such problems, and it can reflect the nature of the system. The dynamic logic combines the people's logic analysis with the dynamic property of the control system. On the basis of the dynamic logic qualitative model, the analyzing process and synthesizing process may go on. So there are many of the non-linear and logic factors which can be directly taken into consideration in the analyzing and designing process. The combination of the human intelligence and artificial intelligent techniques with the conventional methods of analysis and design, has provide an effective tool for the qualitative analysis and the qualitative design of the intelligent control system. We have successfully resolved the stabilizing problem of the inverted pendulum with dynamic logic.

AB  - One of the problems in the development of the medical knowledge systems is the limitations of the system's knowledge. It is a common expectation to increase the number of diseases contained in a system. Using a high density knowledge representation method designed by us, we have developed the Enormous Knowledge Base of Disease Diagnosis Criteria (EKBDDC). It contains diagnostic criteria of 1,001 diagnostic entities and describes nearly 4,000 items of diagnostic indicators. It is the core of a huge medical project--the Electronic-Brain Medical Erudite (EBME). This enormous knowledge base was implemented initially on a low-cost popular microcomputer, which can aid in the prompting of typical disease and in teaching of diagnosis. The knowledge base is easy to expand. One of the main goals of EKBDDC is to increase the number of diseases included in it as far as possible using a low-cost computer with a comparatively small storage capacity. For this, we have designed a high density knowledge representation method. Criteria of various diagnostic entities are respectively stored in different records of the knowledge base. Each diagnostic entity corresponds to a diagnostic criterion data set; each data set consists of some diagnostic criterion data values (Table 1); each data is composed of two parts: integer and decimal; the integral part is the coding number of the given diagnostic information, and the decimal part is the diagnostic value of this information to the disease indicated by corresponding record number. For example, 75.02: the integer 75 is the coding number of "hemorrhagic skin rash"; the decimal 0.02 is the diagnostic value of this manifestation for diagnosing allergic purpura. TABULAR DATA, SEE PUBLISHED ABSTRACT. The algebraic sum method, a special form of the weighted summation, is adopted as mathematical model. In EKBDDC, the diagnostic values, which represent the significance of the disease manifestations for diagnosing corresponding diseases, were determined empirically. It is of a great economical, practical, and technical significance to realize enormous knowledge bases of disease diagnosis criteria on a low-cost popular microcomputer. This is beneficial for the developing countries to popularize medical informatics. To create the enormous international computer-aided diagnosis system, one may jointly develop the unified modules of disease diagnosis criteria used to "inlay" relevant computer-aided diagnosis systems. It is just like assembling a house using prefabricated panels.

AB  - This is a medical examination system with artificial intelligence. It is used to find persons who want to obtain higher professional posts in the medical field, including doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmaceutists, etc. It has a question bank of 536,000 multiple choice questions (MCQs), of which 59,500 have pictures. Ten percent of the MCQs is updated every year; the old MCQs in the question bank are used as exercises for the persons who want to obtain higher professional posts. The system, with three distinctive degrees of difficulty, is applicable to three different professional posts: the assistant physician, the resident, and the attending physician. It ensures the general level of assessment for the same professional post, regardless of when one wants to take the system. In addition, the system also guarantees the consistency of the following three factors: the constituent of sub-professions, the classification of MCQs, and the degree of difficulty of each MCQ. Another feature of the system is that the passing score need not be the traditional standard passing score of 60. The passing score is determined by the system according to the requirements of the different professional posts and the degree of difficulty of the MCQs in the system. Therefore, the new method for passing the system is more rational than the traditional one. Moreover, the final score given by the system will be standardized to eliminate sampling errors. The reliability of the system will also be tested after each examination. If the coefficient of reliability is lower than 0.85, the scores will be canceled and examination will be repeated. The system can accept 96 persons simultaneously taking the examination with on-line computers. The people who work in remote places can take examination in their hospital with a personal computer linked via telephone. The system has already been approved by the relevant authoritative departments in China. It has been running successfully for more than six years. During this period of time, 125,645 candidates have taken the exam; 64,078 have passed the examination and have been promoted to higher professional posts. The system runs on local area network and uses a program written in PROLOG and FoxPro. It is estimated that the total cost of developing the system is less than $46,000 (US).

AB  - Deep-model-based qualitative reasoning provides a systematic framework for describing qualitative physical phenomena. However, as physical systems become more and more complex, the computational load and complexity of qualitative simulation increase dramatically. Multistage separation processes are among the most important unit operations in chemical engineering. An industrial-scale multistage separation process is normally described by some tens or hundreds of quantitative equations. Qualitative reasoning for this type of process is difficult, if not impossible. Since multistage separation processes are highly structured (e.g. cascaded stages), the concept of model simplification (or model reduction), often seen in the practice of process control, is applied to qualitative modeling. The objective of this work is to simplify the qualitative process model according to the structural properties of the multistage separation processes. The simplified qualitative model can, on the one hand, reduce the computational load in qualitative simulation and, on the other hand, retain the qualitative description of the system. In this work, the simplest qualitative model, the signed directed graph (SDG), is used and the most common multistage separation process, using distillation columns, is studied. Qualitative simulation results show that qualitative-model simplification offers an attractive approach for reasoning about important, practical problems. © 1995.

AB  - This paper presents two compensation methods for multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) which are very difficult to train by traditional Back Propagation (BP) methods. For MLPs trapped in local minima, compensating methods can correct the wrong outputs one by one using constructing techniques until all outputs are right, so that the MLPs can skip from the local minima to the global minima. A hidden neuron is added as compensation for a binary input three-layer perceptron trapped in a local minimum; and one or two hidden neurons are added as compensation for a real input three-layer perception. For a perceptron of more than three layers, the second hidden layer from behind will be temporarily treated as the input layer during compensation, hence the above methods can also be used. Examples are given.

AB  - The problem of clustering N patterns into m classes may be regarded as a combinatorial optimization, classification, or vector quantization. The goal of a clustering procedure is in most cases to minimize a cost metric. However, existing methods (such as the well-known K-means algorithm and its variants) are unable to avoid that clustering results are trapped into a local optimum. This paper develops a clustering algorithm based on a heuristic search strategy of artificial intelligence, which can determine the globally optimal classification. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to promote the performance both in computation and in storage. An example on a real-world data set is illustrated. Also, the clustering problem with an unknown class number is dealt with in this contribution. © 1995.

AB  - This paper addresses a new approach, Optimal Path Estimation Method (OPEM), to implement the time optimal bang-bang control. The method is based on feedback information obtained by estimating die distance from the present state to the switching surface along the optimal trajectory. A fuzzy control algorithm is used for the implementation of the control logic. The method is able to eliminate the chattering phenomenon common to the conventional trajectory following controller, and it is shown that the system trajectory will eventually enter a finite region around the target point and stay in the region from then on. It is also shown that the size of the final region around the target point is determined by the controller configuration. The advantages of the proposed method over traditional Bang-Bang control method are illustrated by numerical simulations of a servomotor system. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Soil is a product of weathering. The factors that affect the naming of soil are quite complex. Based on the three main factors (plastic index, liquid limit water capacity, and clay content), and by using a typical neural network - back-propagation model (Yin Hongfeng, Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, 1990, 3(1), 1-12) the author is trying to give a quantitative soil classification. As a more satisfying result was obtained, the neural network model is expected to be referred to as an effective technique for soil classification. © 1995.

AB  - Based on the work of Ref. [1], using artificial intelligence language Arity Prolog, an expert system was developed on IBM PC and its compatible machines. The system can automatically yield an approximate analytical solution with any order for various accelerator single-freedom nonlinear components. As an example, the eighth order approximate analytical solution was derived by this expert system for a general accelerator signal-freedom nonlinear component. It shows that the design of the expert system is successful.

AB  - A system which can quickly obtain and deal with signals of ECG (electrocardiogram) and PLG (pulsilogram) was presented. Based on traditional digital signal processing, the adaptive neural network and wavelet techniques were adopted. Before the acquisition of body signals, artificial neural network of the system is trained, and the network adaptively establishes different health models according to different users. Then the system acquires body signals and processes them by the neural network. These data are compared with the health model in the network. In this way, the noises can be effectively eliminated. Experimental results show that the system has great potential in obtaining, analyzing and recognizing human health information.

AB  - The increment algorithm with limited grey-level was improved. The training set with edge enhancement was proposed to calculate the interconnection weights. The recognition results for four kinds of aircrafts with edge enhancement, which rotate in plane, indicate that this method can further reduce the grey-levels of the interconnection weights and is suitable for optical implementation. The neural network based on target edge enhancement can correctly recognize all the target patterns. And for the partially-hidden patterns, the recognition ratio is 98.2% when the hidden portion is less than 5%, and for the patterns with noise, the recognition ratio is 91.5% when the noise ratio is less than 3.8%.

It is believed to be entirely new. C-IDSS is much more convenient and flexible through an ingenious synergistic combination of graphics and menu driven technique. Another improvement concerns knowledge management. Essentially it involves a new arrangement of architecture in the C-IDSS system. This arrangement is based on new consideration for its design. Both laboratory and field tests indicate that C-IDSS works out very well. It has hence been adopted by a number of manufacturing concerns in China.

AB  - A fast incoherent optoelectronic hybrid neural network system was reported for pattern recognition of multiplex 3-D objects with error tolerance. In the first network, the positive and negative interconnections and parallel processing were used. A white-light source was used to replace He-Ne laser and a TFT liquid crystal display panel was used as a real-time input device. In this system, coherent noise was eliminated, moreover, fast recognition and smaller size were realized.

AB  - A back-propagation neural network model was used to predict the physicochemical properties of organic compounds. The efficiency of linear regression and principal component analysis for determining the input parameters was demonstrated. The normal boiling points, critical temperatures, critical volumes, critical pressures, vaporization enthalpies and eccentric factors of organic compounds can be predicted quantitatively by neural network. The estimation accuracy is good enough to meet the demand for chemical engineering simulation and design.

AB  - Based on one of the improved probabilistic neural network models - FD0 (full domain optimum) neural network, the paper presented an idea of taking the effect of the 8 neighbors of every pix element into consideration in designing the convergent domain of the network. The activation function of the network was modified, thus, endowing the network with good stability and high running speed. The recognition capabilities of FD0 network and its improved version were compared in the simulation experiment. The result proves that the improved network is especially suitable for the recognition of targets with Gaussian noise.

AB  - A general complex neural unit integrated with synaptic connection and lateral interaction was proposed. Various kinds of connections can be generated automatically by using different routing codes contained in the input stimuli. Based on the mixed negabinary system, an inner-product algorithm was suggested to perform complex matrix-vector multiplications without carries, signs and decimal points. An incoherent optical correlator with spatial coding was developed to execute the algorithm, thus the complex neural network was implemented optically in parallel. Numerical simulations and experiments of laterally inhibited Hopfield neural network were demonstrated.

AB  - The self-learning ability and the classification function of the artificial neural network (ANN) were used to study the acid treatment process of solder alloys. Based on the experimental data obtained in the factory, an ANN was established. The trained ANN could acquire the relations between the production conditions and acid treatment effects. From the verification of CuZnAg solder, it is proved that the neural network could successfully predict the effects of the acid treatment, and could easily determine the parameters of the acid treatment process (acid concentration and acid treatment time) under different production conditions. It is concluded that the ANN provides an effective method for predicting the properties of materials. It is also a basis for further materials' design.

AB  - The topological expression of power systems is drawing wide attention in the intelligence engineering. In this paper, a topological model of power systems is established by using an object-oriented method. Based on this model, an improved method is proposed and accomplished to minimize the path for electric power systems restoration. The simulation results indicate that this model can describe power systems directly and concisely and the method is effective. The program of modelling and path minimization is written in C++ and has better maintainability and reusability.

AB  - Research involving some sort of combination of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has attracted a lot of attention recently. Some current work combining GAs and ANNs can be divided into two broad categories: supportive combinations, which typically involve using a genetic algorithm to select training data and to interpret the output behavior of neural networks; collaborative combinations, which typically involve using the GA to determine the neural network weights or the network topology or both. This article presents a review of the state of art and research prospects in this area.

AB  - The understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) in knowledge engineering is still a debatable issue. In this paper, the idea of object as intelligent agent was proposed based on knowledge representation (KR) hypothesis, where an intelligent agent is defined as a carrier encapsulating KR structure and process. Based on this, agent-oriented programming (AOP) in AI software was discussed with an AI programming language and environment ROOT and Wise Men Puzzle.

AB  - Introduces an active database management system RuBDBMS which integrates the production rule system and the ORACLE DBMS. The rule subsystem called RuMES is implemented in the C language. A syntax is defined for the production rule definition as an extension to SQL. The rules are triggered by changes of database, and the condition and action parts of our production rules may refer to the current state of database as well as changes of the database. The rule subsystem provides a rule language facility to the programmers of database applications so that the integrity constraints, alerter and other active database system features can be achieved.

AB  - Reported here is about the trouble diagnosis system for AN-24 aircraft engine which has been realized by inputting the experiences of the repair mechanics or experts of the engine as a computer software.The system is composed of following four sections which are called "model" ; a phenomena model, an inference model, a learning model, and an interpretation model.Therefore, the system is called as "model diagnosis system". These four models are relatively independent which makes parallel operation, easy debugging, and addition of new knowledge possible. The experience of the engine experts has been stored initially to outer knowledge base in the computer. Intermidiate knowledge which arises on the process of the inference is treated at inner knowledge base. The inner knowledge base adopts a blackboard structure. This makes the system not only able to diagnose the vague preconditioned reason, but also to diagnose the unpreconditioned one by learning. The validity of the system was proved from some experiments.

AB  - The cost estimation now is a vital concern of every manufacturing firm, and many methods are available for cost estimation. In this paper, we build an novel architecture of multiagent system with each agent representing one kind of cost estimation method (distributed multi-agent system). The system first classifies the user's requests , then makes the expert agents to cooperate and compete to fulfill the task. The model is based on a fuzzy classification of cost estimation methods and a dynamic optimization of structure to make the agents to learn from the past (based on agent reputation). In this way, the amount of information exchange is considerably reduced.

AB  - A new concept isotropy for robot's force sensors is presented on the basis of Fisher's information matrix M. Special emphasis are put on the equivalence representation and its invariance with respect to coordinate transformation. Ideally, the isotropic sensors may be thought of as maximally informative. However, it is necessary to identify the behavior of force sensors in performing robotic assembly tasks. The task models in the wrench space can be used to define the quality measures for assembly planning and other tasks. It is shown that the optimality conditions for assembly execution are related to the tasks, environment model and the structure parameters of robot's force sensors.

AB  - A new control strategy, called as goal-oriented intelligent fuzzy control, is proposed for the water turbine regulation and control. It is based on the artificial intelligence and fuzzy control, taking the dynamic and static optimal performance of the controlled system as the goal. The proposed strategy leads to overall transforming not only the working principle, but also the configuration of both controller and hydraulic servomechanism. The simulation studies have shown that this new control strategy has satisfactory performance.

AB  - Based on interval fuzzy sets, the inductive learning space is fuzzified, the distinction interval is newly defined to measure the learnable performance of concepts to be learned. By applying the operator of partition for basic event space, the value of distinction interval and the efficiency of inductive learning for concepts to be learned are improved. Fuzzy Inductive learning Algorithm (ILA) is presented for fuzzy inductive learning problems. In terms of the example sets of concepts offered by experts, algorithm ILA can learn fuzzy inference rules about concepts to be learned. Finally, the complexity of algorithm ILA is also discussed.

AB  - Fault-tolerant control systems have been studied very actively during recent years. Software and hardware redundancy techniques are the most common methods used to solve the problems. In recent years, expert systems or artificial intelligence have been used successfully in fault diagnosis of the dynamic systems and their suitability for fault-tolerant control problems has also been demonstrated. In this paper an on-line expert system-based fault-tolerant control system (ESFTC) is considered which allows reconfiguration of the controller in feedback process systems during sensor or actuator failures or misoperation. It forms an on-line expert system, which consists of an analytical problem solution, a process knowledge base, a knowledge acquisition part and an inference mechanism. The analytical problem solution is based on process coefficient changes, which are symptoms of process faults. A controller is reconfigured based on the symptoms. The process knowledge base comprises analytical knowledge in the form of process performances and heuristic knowledge in the form of fault trees and fault statistics. In the phase of knowledge acquisition the process specific knowledge, like theoretical process models, the abnormal behavior, failures and misoperation, is compiled. The inference mechanism performs the fault-tolerant controller, based on the observable symptoms, controller trees, fault probabilities and process history. Case study experiments with the Yeast Fermentation Process Control System show the performance of the fault-tolerant controller. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This paper gives an outline of knowledge base revision and some recently presented complexity results about propositional knowledge base revision. Different methods for revising propositional knowledge base have been proposed recently by several researchers, some are formula - based methods and the others are model - based methods, but all methods are intractable in the general case. This paper discusses a formula - based method - Ginsberg's method, and presents a polynomial algorithm when the number of formulas is far less than the number of variables.

AB  - IN order to overcome a local optimal solution which often occurs in the training process of artificial neural networks, a new algorithm called EGA is proposed. An adaptive multipoint mutation operator, which can effectively extinguish the swing problem in convergent process, is proposed in this algorithm. So the speed of BP training is improved. A reasonable mutation factor range is found. As a result, the speed and accuracy of training artificial neural networks are much improved.

AB  - To support the effective reasoning in the circumstances of incomplete and insufficient facts, the author presented an inductive machine learning method, and designed a rule vector projection algorithm. With the method implemented by the algorithm the primitive knowledge are processed by inductive approach, created a network knowledge base full of new classification concepts and paths for reasoning. Based on the knowledge base the quantity of facts needed in a diagnostic decision making by a machine inference system can sharply be reduced, thus a high performance can still be achieved by the system, despite of short information.

AB  - In the real world, AI systems are constantly and adversely influenced by noisy data. This is also true of EBL (explanation - based learning). This paper discusses how to cope with noisy data in explanation - based learning and proposes a NR - EBL (noise - resistant explanation - based learning) algorithm. Unlike existing algorithms, NR - EBL can learn macro rules and find the problem distribution when there is noise in training examples. Also unlike similar work, NR - EBL reveals the dependency of classifying examples correctly upon the regularities of noise and attempts to detect noise regularities from a set of training examples. With the help of knowledge of noise regularities, NR - EBL can have a higher rate of correct recognition than traditional algorithms and previous work. NR - EBL is the combination of explanation - based learning and statistical pattern recognition. Traditional algorithms are only special cases of NR - EBL when there is no noise in training examples.

AB  - One of the intelligent workshop scheduling applications is an expert system that is responsible for the rules selection in a production rule-based scheduling system. However, the rules selection in existing systems always happens before the simulation starts (called Static Scheduling). It means that once the simulation starts, scheduling system can not select the proper rules again according to the current workshop status, the knowledge's shortage of such an expert system is another big issue. This paper shows the structure of a Intelligent Workshop Scheduling System, which the rule selection happens within the process of simulation (called Dynamic Scheduling), and which has a machine learning module.

AB  - This paper suggests a new kind of composite structure for Decision Tree (DT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANM), which is used to simulate the power system dynamic security region (DSR). Furthermore, it proposes an improved training method for the ANN. At the same time, by the knowledge of approximated DSR, a measure to improve the method of the preparing patterns is presented. The test on an illustrative example power system shows that after adopting the above three methods, the training speed of DT-ANN is raised higher by nearly one quantity grade than that of traditional DT and ANN, and there is very high precision near to the boundary of DSR.

AB  - Real-time fault diagnosis for turbine generators is a fairly complex problem. Parallel processing and distributed artificial intelligence (DAI), as rapidly emerging and promising technologies, provide powerful tools for solving this difficult problem. Based on the study of the basic fault diagnosis process for turbine generators, the idea of parallel processing and DAI is introduced into the field of fault diagnosis. Parallelism at four different levels in the fault diagnosis process is proposed. It lays down the theoretical basis for the development of a real-time parallel distributed fault diagnosing system for the turbine generator of a 300 MW fossil power plant. The diagnostic system can continuously monitor the vibration of the turbine generator as well as various process data. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This paper deals with automatic object recognition (AOR) on a complex background. Based on the domain knowledge and principles of perceptual organization, a heuristic two-stage identifying algorithm is proposed to extract and identify small objects of unknown location in outdoor images of visible spectral bands. Corresponding heuristic knowledge and assumptions are used for each stage. This algorithm is capable of making effective use of two kinds of image features that are imperfect but have a certain degree of complementarity, i.e. regions and edges, thus enhancing the ability of the machine vision system to extract and identify 3D small objects on a complicated background. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness and practicality of the method proposed. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - A "Human-Imitating Intelligent Control Theory" with "generalized reduction" and "Human Imitating" concepts as its kernel is proposed. And a world puzzle in the control circles is solved successfully based on this theory. The puzzle is the well-known "triple inverted pendulum control" using a SINGLE motor. A human-imitating intelligent technique to control inverted pendulum is here described. The successful experimental results show that our control objective can be achieved without a precise mathematical model of the plant. Finally, general principles of designing complex automatic control systems based on the human-imitating intelligent control theory are concluded.

AB  - Convex programming with linear constraints represents a large class of optimization problems which have wide applications, such as linear programming, quadratic programming and some network flow programming problems. In this paper we discuss the artificial neural network approach based on the Lagrangian multiplier method (Lagrangian ANN) to it. The emphases of the paper are on analysing the defect of premature of the conventional Lagrangian ANN and giving a new modification to it in order to overcome its premature defect. We prove that this modified Lagrangian ANN can always give the optimal solution. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modification. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel method for extracting the geometric primitives from geometric data, which is essentially an optimization problem. Specifically, we use tabu search to solve geometric primitive extraction problem. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt that tabu search is used in computer vision. Our tabu search (TS) has a number of advantages: (1) TS avoids entrapment in local minima and continues the search to give a near-optimal final solution; (2) TS is very general and conceptually much simpler than either simulated annealing (SA) or genetic algorithm (GA); (3) TS has no special space requirement and is very easy to implement (the entire procedure only occupies a few lines of code); (4) our TS-based method can successfully extract some geometric primitives which are specially difficult for the traditional methods such as Hough Transform (HT) and Robust Statistics (RS). TS is a flexible framework of a variety of strategies originating from artificial intelligence and is therefore open to further improvement. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - A natural deduction system was adapted from Gentzen system. It enables valid wffs to be deduced in a very 'natural' way. One need not transform a formula into other normal forms. Robinson's unification algorithm is used to handle clausal formulas. Algorithms for eliminating and introducing quantifiers without Skolemization are presented, and unification theorems for them are proved. A natural deduction automated theorem prover based on the algorithms was implemented. The rules for quantifiers are controlled by the algorithms. The Andrews challenge and the halting problem were proved by the system.

AB  - Various analysis methods have been used to process rock mechanical problems. They have different adaptability. How do we select one or several analysis methods for the given geological conditions and engineering required? How do we decide what kind of results are good or more suitable? It often needs the users' experience. Therefore, how shall we proceed in rock mechanics? One way is to apply artificial intelligence to rock mechanics. A combination of fuzzy mathematics, system science and other nonlinear mechanics with rock mechanics could lead to the development of a new branch of rock mechanics. This new branch could be called 'intelligent rock mechanics and rock engineering'.
Today, rock mechanics is becoming increasingly important in the mining and civil engineering fields as a means of providing better understanding of the mechanical behavior of rock masses. Perhaps the best way to proceed in rock mechanics is to apply artificial intelligence to rock mechanics. A combination of fuzzy mathematics, system science and other nonlinear mechanics with rock mechanics leads to the development of a new branch of rock mechanics, the so-called 'intelligent rock mechanics and rock engineering'.

AB  - Uniaxial bianisotropic-semiconductor material is a generalization of the wellstudied semiconductor material and uniaxial medium. It could be realized by arranging chiral objects in a host semiconductor medium, with a preferred direction. This class of material probably opens up the opportunity to realize artificial intelligence in living organisms. In the present study, based on the concept of characteristic waves and the method of angular spectral expansion, electromagnetic field representations in this class of materials are developed. The analysis indicates that solutions of source-free Maxwell equations for uniaxial bianisotropic-semiconductor material can be represented in sum-integral forms of cylindrical vector wave functions. Addition theorem of vector wave functions for uniaxial bianisotropic-semiconductor material can be straightforwardly derived from that of vector wave functions for isotropic medium. An application of the proposed theory in scattering is presented to show how to use these formulations in a practical way. © Les Éditions de Physique 1997.

First, artificial intelligence was used to identify the pressure derivative plots of well test model, and a modular recognition system constructed with expert system was set up. Then the artificial neural networks was used to identify the well test interpretation model. This system can identify the well test interpretation model according to the new well test data. Finally the neural networks and expert system were used together for well test interpretation. Practical identification results show that the method is very effective. It can identify incomplete well test data even with noise. The identification accuracy is very high compared with other methods.

A series of self-learning algorithms for MFNNs can be obtained based on ANNs theory, Fuzzy Set theory and its special structure. Some simulation results based on MFNNs gradient algorithm show that the convergence performance of MFNNs is much better than ordinary ANNs, the self-learning and self-adjustment are practicable, simple and effective. The learning model can be used for intelligent control system including the complicated object control. The VLSI realization of the learning MFNNs can be implemented easily.

AB  - Artificial neural network (ANN) has been widely used in fault diagnosis of power transformer. One of the main weak-points of the back propagation algorithm which is commonly used is that the optimal procedure is easily stacked into the minimal value locally and causes strict demands of initial value. Based on genetic algorithm (GA), this paper proposes GA-ANN algorithm to optimize the initial value of ANN structure. Some examples are given to prove GA-ANN algorithm is powerful to diagnose the faults of power transformers.

AB  - This paper proposes a new communication agent, called CORA (common object request agent). The purpose of this approach is to improve the reliability of communication using time-out in open distributed system based on client/server model. In CORA model, the application client could have more control over server's processing the request through the feedback mechanism of time segment transaction, and provide time-out's handling for preventing the bad propagation of the partial failure so that the whole system becomes more robust.

AB  - It is known that existed causal reasoning methods will have problems to propagate the causal behaviors when there are some conflicts. To solve this problem, the authors provide a causal relation formulation, which introduces the concepts of 'time' and 'effect'. Then a process for causal reasoning is provided: constructs the causal relation graph, then propagates the causal behaviors of the reason variables (exogenous variables), and uses qualitative algebra to solve conflicting cases. It is an extension of Iwasaki's causal reasoning method.

AB  - An artificial neural network is used for representing the complex nonlinear mapping relationship between the grasp mode and the grasped object oriented properties, such as the geometric shape, dimensions and the pose of the object in a platform. The neural network is trained by example, then the trained neural network is applied to generate automatically the grasp mode. At the same time, we discuss the general force distribution problem for multifingered grasp, where the contact type between the object and fingers may be a point contact with friction or a soft finger contact and the grasp may be an asymmetrical 3D-grasp. In order to make real time grasp possible, applying the BP-network and FL-network to deal with the complicated force planning strategy. A nonlinear programming method which is applied to train the two networks is presented. Comparison of the training process of the two networks indicates that the later converges more quickly to the smaller error. The results obtained by simulation show that the FL-network is able to real time plan the required joint driven torques and demonstrate that the represented planning method is efficient.

AB  - In this paper, a new approach is proposed, which is used to identify and classify mobile robot's present perceptual environment and then achieve obstacle avoidance. First, we have studied and analyzed the extraction technique of the feature vectors which represent the present perceptual environment, and built up the training database of the desired feature vectors that stand for our desired environment categories. Then, based on ART2 neural network, a classifier is designed, which is used to achieve quickly identification and classification for the present perceptual environment by means of the multi - sensors information. On the basis of these, a 3D fuzzy controller for mobile robot obstacle avoidance in an unknown environment is given out by use of fuzzy logic techniques. Experiments show that the speed of classification and identification is improved to a great extent, and the mobile robot can move safely and quickly in an unknown environment.

In this paper, a method used in circumscription is given. When a theory is suited with complete axiom and positive reason assumption, it can be proved that the consistent explanation is exactly the abductive explanation in the circumscription. Furthermore, an algorithm using in Horn clauses is given.

AB  - A knowledge-based multipath feedback closed system model is proposed for optimal design of zoned support constructions of underground excavations. This model studies rockmass classification, engineering stability of rock masses, optimal selection of zoned support system as a complete system along with interesting and fruitful applications of artificial intelligence and expert system. In this model, rock masses are considered as a complicated system which are affected by various geological factors (e.g. divorced seams, faults, joints, tectonics, etc.), as well as engineering or mining factors. The results of engineering stability of rock masses and excavating conditions of engineering are considered as input of the system, and consequences affected by excavating of engineering are considered as outputs of the system. As a result, models and parameters of the system are recognized by the inputs and outputs of the system, whether the system is known, unknown or uncertain. By repeated refining and learning, the optimal overall solutions are obtained on agreement of multipath including expert's decision of rock mass class and stability, theoretical analysis, numerical simulation results, in-site monitoring feedback and experimental analysis. This closed intelligent model overcomes the shortcomings of low precision of unitary path approach and part optimum.

AB  - Calculating illumination-invariant attributes is very important in applications such as colour object recognition. Supervised colour constancy, which uses colour chart to calculate and correct illumination changes, is used widely because of its simplicity and efficacy. This paper proposes a new supervised colour constancy algorithm based on histogram analysis of a colour chart. It differs from Novak's method in that it does not need to know the spectral reflectance functions of colour chips and the camera spectral sensitivity, thus simplifies implementation greatly. The main thoughts of the algorithm and its implementation in real imaging systems were given, and the experiment results were shown.

AB  - The determinations of MBPS (minimum break point set) for optimal coordination of directional protective relays in a multiloop network is reduced to a 0-1 integer linear programming problem firstly. Based on the principle of neural optimization computation, a new neural approach to determine MBPS is presented, in which the simulated annealing technique and SUMT (sequence unconstrained optimization technique) of penalty function method are applied to the Tank & Hopfield linear programming neural network, and the computational complexity of solving the MPBS problem is decreased. Simulation research reveals that the probability of obtaining global optimal solution is near to 1 by the method proposed, the robustness to initial parameters of TH ANN is enhanced, and the pseudo-solution problem of neural optimization computation is solved.

AB  - In this paper, three types of weld flaw were taken as target, evaluation and recognition of flaw echo features were studied. On the basis of experimental study and theoretical analysis, 26 features have been extracted from each echo samples. A method which is based on the statistical hypothesis testing and used for feature evaluation and optimum subset selection was explored. Thus, the dimensionality reduction of feature space was brought out, and simultaneously the amount of calculation was decreased. An intelligent pattern classifier with B-P type neural network was constructed which was characterized by high speed and accuracy for learning. Using a half of total samples as training set and others as testing set, the learning efficiency and the classification ability of network model were studied. The results of experiment showed that the learning rate of different training samples was about 100%. The results of recognition was satisfactory when the optimum feature subset was taken as the sample's feature vectors. The average recognition rate of three type flaws was about 87.6%, and the best recognition rate amounted to 97%.

AB  - The idea of metasynthesis from the qualitative to the quantitative is applied to pattern recognition. The main point of metasynthesis is to combine computer system with human intelligence. Thus, in pattern recognition, it can be realized by supervised learning. A new integration method, named NISL (Network Integration on the basis of Supervised Learning) is proposed to combine multiple recognition systems. Obviously, NISL makes full use of human aids so that a better result can be achieved. The exciting result of an experiment which combined four unconstrained handwritten numeral recognition systems fully demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the idea of NISL can be developed to establish the templates of complex patterns, such as handwritten Chinese characters. Since the concept of template plays an important role in image thinking, NISL contributes greatly to both noetic science and pattern recognition, Thus lays a foundation for the computer recognition of unconstrained handwritten Chinese characters.

AB  - Automatic programming is one of the central goals of computer science. Recently there is a breakthrough at theory of this field, that is the theory of evolutionary computation, especially, the achievements on the theory and methodology of genetic programming. In this paper, from three aspects the authors show that the genetic programming methodology has brought some hopes for automatic programming. Firstly, GP provides some basic methods for automatic programming because it possessed some characteristics of intelligence, such as adaptation, self-organization and self-learning. Secondly, it possesses inherent parallelism which allows to use modern massively parallel computers, that is, the modern parallel computing technology provides the material basis to realize the automatic programming. Finally, by comparing some results evolved by GP to results got by human being the authors conclude that the dream of automatic programming is coming true. Some new concepts such as program structure and automatic programming which extend the concepts of GP are proposed too.

AB  - 3-D image reconstruction, visualization and analysis application in stereotactic radiosurgery are discussed. For 3-D visualization and analysis, labeled 2-D slices are registered on a 3-d grid. The surface- and volume-based methods of image reconstruction and segmentation are used. The surface-based method extracts a surface of the structure of interest and represents it as a set of surface elements. The volume method involves labeling by classification and direct segmentation. Two treatment planning systems composed of image input and planning subsystems are also described.

AB  - In existing theories and methods for qualitative reasoning, there are some deficiencies of the capability of describing the real world. This paper developed K. Forbus' QPT (qualitative process theory) and proposed an extended way QUIOS to describe Qualitative reasoning. In this approach, the quantity types of QPT are generalized widely and the mechanism of expressing open physical systems is shown with the aid of processes restricted and guided by events. Besides, after having introduced the new concept of Quantity Views, this paper presented two sorts of inheritance mechanism about quantities in QUIOS and have shown that they will not raise any contradiction under given conditions.

AB  - PID control method is difficult to control electrohydraulic servo systems, which possess natural nonlinearity and time varing properties, to get good performance. But the human intelligence simulating control, based on PID, is a kind of intelligent control, which simulates human intelligent activities when one controls the moving objects. This control method will not make destructive interference among the rapid, steady and accurate response characterist'cs, but the traditional PID will. The human being intelligence simulating control can make the system behave well according to man's will in three stages: accelerating at starting, braking when overshooting and eliminating error away when steadying. Experiments proved the outstanding performances of human intelligence simulating control.

AB  - In a Case-Based Reasoning environment, solution adaptation is considered the key technique to solve problems in new situation by using past experiences. Most adaptation methods available now need domain ad hoc heuristics as precondition, so they are deficient in systematicness and generality, especially under such a circumstance that ad hoc heuristics could hardly be found. In this paper, a novel tactic of solution adaptation is proposed. It uses hybrid genetic algorithm as a systematic means to optimize solutions from cases. Simulation results have indicated that it is surprisingly effective and efficient in both creativeness and performance.

AB  - This paper presents a new method for image mosaic. Analysis of characteristics of mosaic showed that the registration should be completed as follows. (1) To overcome disturbance and to remove mismatch, a preprocessing for clearing and normalizing subpictures should be required. (2) Fast registration algorithm based on self-learning threshold is suitable for registration of a large number of images. (3) To determine the position of each subpicture in a mosaic picture by clique growth. (4) To eliminate gradient in mosaic image by adjustment of gray average weighted with distance. The merit of this method is that mosaic of multiple images is completed by computer automatically and human bias factors are avoided. The operation is fast and precise. It can also assemble pictures smoothly which is not available by manual method.

AB  - Based on the multilayer feedforward neural network and the time-frequency wavelet, a new kind of generalized self-adaptive wavelet neural network, called GSA WNN, is presented. Adaptation of GSA WNN is more general than that of ordinary wavelet neural network, its structure can be adjusted adaptively. By means of bringing the merge-split algorithm into the learning strategy, the problem of determining the proper size of the network is solved. Therefore, the blindness in the network design can be avoided.

AB  - A looser statistical model is used to analyze the errors of neural networks when limited precision operations are used to design and implement a real-valued double parallel feedforward neural networks (DPFNN). The analysis is based on assumptions on both the expectation bound and variance bound of both inputs and weights, instead of the usual assumptions on the distributions of the neural inputs, weights, states, activational functions etc. The assumptions are much less restrictive and closer to practical situations. As functions of the variance parameters and expectation or mean parameters, general statistical formulations of the performance degradation of the neural network caused by errors in inputs and weights was developed. The study shows that the network's performance degradation gets worse when either variance bounds or mean bounds of the errors in either the inputs or weights are increased; that the error bound of a DPFNN is smaller than that of a MLFNN (multi-layer feedforward neural network); and that both the error bounds of a DPFNN and a MLFNN are increased as the word-length is decreased. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis and simulations also show that when more than 12 bit word-length is used, the effect of quantization on either DPFNN or MLFNN is very small.

AB  - M-norm was necessary for filling up the need of Uncertain Reasoning (UR) in Artificial Intelligence. The t-norm and t-conorm do not fully satisfy the need of UR. They need to be supplemented with M-norm. From the viewpoint of algebraic system, M-norm is defined as a collection of mean-solving models. The main properties of M-norm are presented. Two correlation criteria: interdependent and neutral are proposed. They are similar to three correlation criteria for t-norm and t-conorm.

AB  - A new parallel method for on-line parameter identification by neural networks is proposed to realize the real-time identification. The Hopfield networks is modified by replacing its sigmoidal function with multi-linear function, and then the link matrix and bias of the modified networks are set to guarantee the stability of the networks and to guarantee that the only one equilibrium of the networks be the least squares solution of the parameter identification. In order to meet the requirement of on-line identification, the recurrence formula is given. The simulation results of an underwater vehicle system with the new method show the validity of the method through comparison with the results obtained with traditional least squares identification method.

AB  - The double grid air counter (DGAC) controlled by IBM PC was designed. Its main features are presented as follows: 1. By contrast with Geiger-Mully counter (GMC), the DGAC has overcome the problem of overcounting the number of exoelectrons. The problem with GMC is that a great number of positive ions, discharged from GMC, bombards the metallic sample during the measurement. 2. DGAC is light in weight and small in size owing to the adoption of the integrated circuit of system hardware. Data collection and processing in the system is completed by IBM PC. The system software is programmed by integration of C language and the assembler language; This solves the key problem of the transfer of assembler language by the C language. An integrative software of man and machine with attractive interface has been worked out.

AB  - A Supervised Linear Feature Mapping (SLFM) network is proposed to estimate tool wear. The influences of network parameters on learning speed and performance are discussed. SLFM network is a variant or particular case of Self-Organizing Feature Mapping (SOM) proposed by Kohonen (1982). The SLFM differs from SOM in two respects: (a) The output layer is a linear neuron set to provide a discrete scale estimate of tool wear. (b) The SLFM algorithm uses supervised learning law to adjust the weight vectors, instead of using competitive learning only. A schematic diagram of tool wear monitoring system for turning operation is presented. The system employs multiple sensors (acoustic emission, acceleration and motor power sensors). The output layer of the SLFM has 22 neurons corresponding to a range of 0-0.55mm of flank wear. As comparison, a BP network with 7 inputs, 10 hidden neurons and one output neuron is trained using the same sample set as SLFM network. The results show that SLFM network has lower training iterations and higher accuracy than BP network.

AB  - Some results in analyzing the features of real-time fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of complex dynamic systems are obtained. First, the generally used assumption that an element's current mode is unchanged in a diagnosis process is not applicable; instead we make a more practical assumption that it can transfer from normal to fault at any time. On the basis of this assumption, it is pointed out that the diagnosis methods based on systems' normal model should be used as a general FDD tool and those based on system's fault model an additional one. Second, FDD process control is an important problem which was not considered sufficiently previously. On the basis of above consideration, an integrated FDD strategy (IFDDS) is proposed. IFDDS includes both FDD method and FDD process control. The fundamental FDD method is based on that the FDD theory in artificial intelligence and FDD algorithms in information processing can be embedded in as inference machines. Simulation results of some flight control system show effectiveness of IFDDS.

The results show that the B-P model is not only suitable for the regression and prediction for single variable output non-linear system, but also suitable for multivariables output non-linear system. Perfect fault tolerance ability was also found in the B-P model, while it was used to analyze the mechanical properties of ZA22/Al2O3f composites.

AB  - Argumentation (abduction) is widely applied in artificial intelligence (AI) and law reasoning. However, the problem of how to perform argumentation in disjunctive logic programming (DLP) is still open. In addition, a unifying semantic framework is required for incorporating various semantics for DLP. An argumentation-theoretic framework for DLP by taking the disjuncts of negative literals as abducibles is presented. This semantics not only is a simple and intuitive framework for performing argumentation and abduction in DLP, but also provides a unifying framework for many key semantics of disjunctive logic programs. In particular, it is shown that the EGCWA, well-founded model and disjunctive stable models can all be embedded into this semantics.

AB  - This research aims to propose a new approach to modelling solid shapes, called qualitative solid modelling, for supporting conceptual mechanical design. In a previous paper, a method has been described to represent qualitatively the simplified shapes of solids whose surfaces are all planes and perpendicular to the axes of the given orthogonal coordinate system. A qualitative solid model is defined as a domain network that has domains (cuboids) as its nodes and qualitative spatial relations among the domains as its links. This paper details a number of qualitative solid operations, ranging from the most basic declarations of domains and domain relations to qualitative set operations of domains, that can be combined to facilitate tasks of modelling complex qualitative solid shapes in computers. All operations mentioned in this paper have been implemented in a qualitative solid modelling system, called QuaSMos. The validity and efficiency of several important qualitative solid operations and the qualitative solid modeller QuaSMoS are confirmed with an example of complex solid shapes.

AB  - The concept of well-behaved inference rules is developed in first-order polynomial-based theorem proving. It is shown that well-behaved inference rules are complete for both the set of support strategy and the linear strategy. Furthermore, two concrete inference rules that are well behaved are presented, and two other strategies for them are described.

AB  - Focussing on unification of concrete portions into a generic form of computational evolution, a generalized theoretical framework is necessary and imperative to be built to construct a universal computational theory of evolution machine. The NP problem solving capacity can be traced to the nature of meta-evolution mechanism with emergence features that determine corresponding homeostasis and diversity ranging in the domain of nonlinear mapping from genotype to phenotype. In this paper a criterion that guarantees the global optimality of evolutionary computation process is proposed and proven rigorously. The global optimization criterion obtained is based on the non-parametric measurement for the whole evolution system and has great flexibility and evolvability. It leaves room for evolutionary system designing and development. The formulization of the global description in statistical manifold space of information object family expresses evoluable evolutionary operator architecture and operation procedure in terms of evolution by evolution. The theoretical results are helpful to applications such as machine learning for automatic knowledge acquisition, pattern classification and recognition of complex images (e.q. OCR) and unsupervised system identification of nonlinear dynamical systems as well as chaos phenomena. The kernel of the formal system guided by global evolutionary optimization is proper to the implementation with object-oriented programming paradigm and abstract machine modelling.

AB  - There are many parameters involved in every aspect of power system protection design. Many of them need to be determined unequivocally. However, in practical engineering, both the factors affecting them, and the design knowledge to determine them, may contain uncertainties, which result in fuzziness of the parameters and defects in the design quality. The paper proposes a fuzzy decision-making method for an expert system to deal with the uncertainty of the parameters decision both in knowledge representation and in the inference model. An application of the decision-making system is presented, demonstrating that the method is reasonable and effective. The model proposed has been incorporated into the design of an expert system, greatly extending the capability and scope of intelligent design. © IEE, 1998.

AB  - The characteristic of exiting study about Geographical information systems (GIS) and Geographical expert systems (GES) is the formalization of geographical knowledge utilizing technology of computer software, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI), which ignores the research of logical thinking system by which the geographical experts solve problems. Therefore, to study the methodology of geographical experts' logical thinking, the Geographical Cognition Theory (GCT) which aims at research and simulation on the logical thinking mode of geographers is put forward. On the basis of anlyzing two concepts in the Cognitive Science - Intention and Mental images, two major concepts in the GCT that are Geographical Intention (GI) and Geographical Mental Images (GMI) are proposed. To probe into the connotation of the GCT, the thesis analyses the characteristic and meaning of Geographical Thinking expressed by Geographical Intention and Geographical Mental Images, studies the method and significance of researching geographical methodology with cognitive psychology as a measure. The symbol system of spatial behaviour decision-making is discussed. Furthermore, a mode of spatial behaviour decision-making based on computer is established, and the Information-flow and Knowledge-flow in the mode is discussed, from above the relation and distinction between GIS and GES are disclosed. To the research of contemporary geography, the systematic, comprehensive, regional and practical research methods are emphasized. The research of contemporary geographical methodlogy in turn enhances the research of the geographical theory. The contemporary geography has been recognized as a strongly comprehensive discipline and has its own independent scientific system. It is just the 'scientific and comprehensive nature' of contemporary geographical methodlogy that demand us to research the interior and deep laws of the development of the geographical theory system and method system; and cognitive science and cognitive psychology, as the sciences that specially study the laws of human cognitive process, have just provided the necesary means for the research. The GCT, which is established through the cognitive analysis of the development of geographical theory and methods, is sure to be beneficial to the analysis and research of geographical methodology and hence beneficial to the analysis and research of geographical theoretical system, and it also provides the theoretical basis for GIS and GES.

AB  - Owing to the fact that the gas pipeline is shallowly buried underground, the operation of the spherical pig can't be directly observed in the process of spherical pigging, the change of the pressures at the entrance and exit of pipeline can't be also forecasted in the movement of the spherical pig and it is difficult to accurately control the inlet gas flow to make the spherical pig reaching the exit at a velocity of 1 m/s, for which the design and realization of the computer simulation system for the spherical pigging in gas pipeline are carried out. On the basis of analyzing and studying the factors affecting the operation rule of the spherical pigging in gas pipeline, the simulation system was developed by taking the advanced techniques, such as the data base administration, computer simulation and artificial intelligence, etc., as the major means. The overall structure, function design, program composition and debugging of the simulation system are emphatically introduced in the paper. The movement of the spherical pig in pipeline can be simulated by the simulation system. Through multiple simulation for the operation of the spherical pigging in the gas pipeline from Jingbian to Yushu, its coincidence rate is more than 93%.

AB  - The exploration on knowledge representation and inference mechanism of the computer aided processing planning (CAPP) system was performed. Based on object-oriented technology, the object, knowledge and knowledge processing were packed into an independent unit, which is called intelligent object, and the object-oriented technology knowledge representation was proposed. The conceptual model of the hierarchical technology knowledge base was developed, which creates technology knowledge structure according to classification and hierarchy of intelligent objects. The inference mechanism was classified into inference mechanism within each intelligent object, which represents resolving strategy based on product system, and inference mechanism among the intelligent objects, which is implemented through information communication. The inference mechanism provides the thinking for concurrent solution of technology decision.

AB  - Off-line system for the recognition of free written zip-codes is presented in the paper. The system is built upon five main components. A division module separates the input zip-codes into isolated numeral. The preprocessing module do all the normalizing, noise removing and thinning. The feature division gives several kinds of feature description and extraction. We have two stages of classification, i.e., coarse and detailed. The former uses the inference procedure based on local structure, with Fuzzy pre-classifier being set at the front of the recognition system. The later uses distance matching on subset of prototypes, discrete wavelet transform on some local curve segment, single-layered BP network on whole binary image, which reduces significantly the number of prototypes to be matched with the input digit sample. Experimental results have showed the system is efficient on zip-codes collected from practical envelopes.

AB  - Analogical reasoning technique is significant to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The computing systems based on conventional architecture are very inefficient in doing analogical reasoning. Because of this, the high performance embedded analogical reasoning system, called analogical reasoning coprocessor (ARC), was presented. The confronted difficulties for implementing ARC were analyzed. Since ARC has a specialized architecture with special strategy to support analogical reasoning mechanism and advanced integrated devices are adopted, so the efficiency in speed of analogical reasoning is improved.

AB  - A new neural network model constructed by the RBF function was presented. By using this model, not only the normal classification of the multi-patterns can be carried out, but also the classification of the multi-objects with rotation invariance. The computer simulation of classifying the three kinds of airplanes with rotation invariance was carried out. The results show that this model is very effective for the multi-objects classification with rotation invariance. An opto-electronic implementation was presented.

AB  - A programmable synapse analog CMOS neural network circuit is proposed. The circuit has wide input voltage range. Because the weights are stored in a double-capacitor synapse circuit, the storage time and resolution of the weights are improved. The sigmoid function is realized by using a MOS differential circuit and an I-V converting circuit. The operation principle of the neuron is analyzed in detail. The design formulas are given. A two-layer feedforward network is constructed and the XOR problem is solved by using the proposed circuit. The PSPICE simulation results demonstrate the rightness of the circuits with both the neuron and the feedforward network.

AB  - A new algorithm to deal with the shortcuts of traditional backpropagation algorithm was proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the hidden layer is directed by knowledge. The training effects are improved and the number of hidden neurons can be easily determined. The training needs not be restarted entirely when adding new patterns, so that the training time will be saved.

AB  - The differences between inductive inference and deductive inference were studied. The formal logic framework for inductive inference was presented and the concepts of reconstruction and deductive sequence were defined. In addition, the inductive procedure to generate inductive sequences was given. It has proved that if the sequence of all instances is known for the model, then all inductive sequences generated by the procedure will converge to same limit, i.e. the set of all true sentences of the model from any given theory. The result has interpreted reasonableness of inductive inference rules.

AB  - Analogical reasoning technique is significant to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The computing systems based on conventional architecture are very inefficient in doing analogical reasoning. Because of this, the high performance embedded analogical reasoning system, called analogical reasoning coprocessor (ARC), was presented. The confronted difficulties for implementing ARC were analyzed. Since ARC has a specialized architecture with special strategy to support analogical reasoning mechanism and advanced integrated devices are adopted, so the efficiency in speed of analogical reasoning is improved.

AB  - ATM routing with Hopfield Network is studied. An ATM routing problem is converted to a common communication network routing by taking advantage of the concept of equivalent capacity. Hopfield network is employed in optimal routing. Furthermore this thesis proposes dual routing algorithm to reduce complexity of optimal routing algorithm with Hopfield network only. The dual routing algorithm compromises between optimum of the route and calculation complexity. The simulation result shows that call loss probability is greatly reduced.

AB  - A kind of similarity measure with selective attentional property is proposed. The neural network (Selective Attentional Template Matching Network, SATMN in brief) model built with the proposed measure can be applied to template matching and classification. The model is composed of matching subnetwork and competitive subnetwork, in which comparison and classification are carried out respectively. The similarity measure is available to both binarized and continuous patterns, and the experimental results show that it is superior to several widely used similarity measures in describing the variance between patterns. The implementation method and experimental results for neural network are given.

AB  - The basic operations in the language processing were classified from view point of the entity and the attribute respectively, and the two sets of basic operations, i.e. attribute-driven operation set and entity alternation operation set, were defined systematically. The attribute-derived operation set consists of single-phase operation, aggregate operation, disaggregate operation and split operation, but the entity alternation operation set includes create operation and fill operation. These operations are the basis of designing the architecture of the language processing model and the language processing function component, and are also beneficial for building the more economic knowledge processing scheme and general information description mechanism.

AB  - The differences between inductive inference and deductive inference were studied. The formal logic framework for inductive inference was presented and the concepts of reconstruction and deductive sequence were defined. In addition, the inductive procedure to generate inductive sequences was given. It has proved that if the sequence of all instances is known for the model, then all inductive sequences generated by the procedure will converge to same limit, i.e. the set of all true sentences of the model from any given theory. The result has interpreted reasonableness of inductive inference rules.

AB  - Spatial layout automation is one of the research directions in intelligent CAD domain. The aim is to provide tools for designers to solve the layout problems emerged in building planning, facility planning, VLSI floor planning and product packaging. Human designers can interact with the tools and find some new creative solutions. The graph theoretic method is one of the main approaches in the research of spatial layout. One of the difficulties in layout design is the representation of layout knowledge and constraints. Former layout models can not fully represent layout knowledge and constraints. The drawbacks of former models lead the design process uncontrolled. This paper represents a normal-constraint-graph model and a hierarchical-constraint-graph model that can be used in 2D or 3D layout design .The two combined models can be used to represent the detailed knowledge and constraints in layout design. Thus, it can overcome the drawbacks of the former layout models. The condition of the existence of the solution of normal and hierarchical constraint graphs is discussed and the layout-plan-generation method based on the normal and hierarchical constraint graphs is given.

AB  - The expert database system (EDBS) with coupled structure of expert system (ES) and database management system (DBMS) was constituted. The Petri nets model was used to the knowledge representation. The mechanism of fuzzy reasoning was described, so the confidence and conclusion were formed by means of fuzzy algorithm to provide reasoning suggestions and predictions for users. The implementation of the EDBS was presented, which includes ES, DBMS, man-machine interface and communication interface, in which DBMS consists of concurrent control, data organization, storage, fault recovery and query, while communication interface is to implement integration of ES and DBMS. The actual investment analysis and decision was used to explain and verify the EDBS.

AB  - We discuss the problem of representing and processing triple-valued or multiple-valued logic knowledge using neural network in this paper. A novel neuron model, triple-valued or multiple-valued logic neuron (TMLN), is presented. Each triple-valued or multiple-valued logic neuron can represent a triple-valued or multiple-valued logic rule by itself. We will show that there are two triple-valued or multiple-valued logic neurons: TMLN-AND (triple-valued or multiple-valued "logic and" neuron) and TMLN-OR (triple-valued or multiple-valued "logic or" neuron). TMLN-AND can realize triple-valued or multiple-valued "logic and" while TMLN-OR can realize triple-valued or multiple-valued "logic or." Two simplified triple-valued or multiple-valued logic neuron models are also presented. We can show that a multiple-layer neural network (TMLNN) made up of triple-valued or multiple-valued logic neurons can implement a triple-valued or multiple-valued logic inference system. The training algorithm for TMLNN is presented and can be shown to converge. In our model, triple-valued or multiple-valued logic rules can be extracted from TMLNN with ease. TMLNN can thus form a base for representing logic knowledge using neural network. © 1998 IEEE.

AB  - The nano-technology requires new methodology to handle difficult problems that involve the information processing, material technology and life phenomena in the nano-world. Concentrating on the synthesis of techniques in scientific frontier fields such as KDD(Knowledge Discovery in Database), evolutionary computation, rough set and logic, a new artificial life model for pattern mining and discovery has been proposed and the corresponding emergent algorithm has been built and implemented. The original contribution of the research work can be summarized in the following two principal respects: (a) pattern mining and discovery for genomic dynamics within the theoretic framework of artificial life; (b) information fusion of multi-paradigm for modeling and building of evolutionary KDD system with rough pattern inference. Through computer experiments the artificial sequence generated by computational processes has matched the evidence convinced by the latest scientific reality. The work is helpful to analyze and build the next generation of bio-nonferrous metal materials in the level of genomics and nano-technology.

AB  - This paper presents a review on the current development of stability control in flexible AC transmission systems from three aspects: mathematical models, installation locations and control strategies. Mathematical models of FACTS devices are described according to their working principles. Various methods of selecting FACTS' installation locations are discussed, and two novel tools are proposed - Normal Form technique and sensitivity analysis using EEAC theory. Applications of nonlinear control and artificial intelligence in FACTS controller design are also expounded. It is pointed out that the key of FACTS synthetic intelligent controller design is the quantitative analysis technique of power system stability.

AB  - Based on the mechanism of acrobatic erecting poles, the imitating-human intelligent control method for the inverted pendulum using phase plane method and human control experiences was proposed. The method combines qualitative analysis and quantitative estimation, and abstracts control rules for single-stage inverted pendulum. By introducing equivalent cart concept, the analytical method for single-stage inverted pendulum control system is readily extended to double, triple or even more stage inverted pendulum control system. The result of the theoretical analysis is consistent with experimental result, it has been indicated that the qualitative analytical method on phase plane is feasible.

AB  - One of the most important issues in computer integrated manufacturing systems is job scheduling. Though many scheduling criteria for job scheduling have been proposed, most of them are impractical for application in the low-volume/high-variety manufacturing environment. This paper reports the development of a knowledge-based dynamic job-scheduling system in the low-volume/high-variety manufacturing environment. The system provides us with a practical facility for job scheduling which takes into account the influence of many factors such as machine setup times, cell changes, replacement machines and load balancing among machines. The system is based on a set of heuristic algorithms and intranet technology. It has been found that the knowledge-based paradigm and the intranet technology are very useful for complex scheduling problems in low-volume/high-variety manufacturing case.

AB  - Traditional Chinese drugs (TCDs) have played a key role for Chinese people in the treatment of diseases since ancient times. The use of TCDs has generated a great amount of information in the past thousand years about the relationship between natural products and the human body. However, up to now, our understanding on the mode of action of the TCD is still limited. Considering that the basic mechanism of all drug function involves the interaction between the drug and biological receptors at the molecular level, we propose to connect TCDs with modern medicine theory through molecular structures. We propose to explain functions of TCDs by using the knowledge developed in modern molecular biology, pharmacology, computer chemistry, and biochemistry. We are working on a computer-aided Chinese drug study that is discussed in this paper. A short introduction on the progress of our research is also given. © 1999 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In order to solve the invalidation of fault analytic software, a kind of improved artificial neural network based on the BP algorithm was proposed and used to simulate some key thermal parameters at real time. This method, which can automatically and simultaneously adjust learning and momentum factor in training process, results in convergence speed-up. The analytic result shows that the error between simulative and real value is less than 1%. Finally, a sample applied in the life management system of steam units starting up and shutting down frequently was given.

AB  - In the method, a three-layer feedforward neural network structure incompletely connected was employed. Each heart beat was divided into three major waves, i.e. P, ARS complex and T waves. The inputs and outputs of each wave were connected by two hidden units respectively. The inputs and outputs in conjunction of the neighbouring waves were also connected by the hidden units. The advantage of this method was that it could enhance the capability of recovering the waveforms without increasing computation burden, it could also efficiently avoid the failure of redisplaying the waveforms when the P and T waves were unstable in waveform or highly noised, thus strengthening the robustness and feasibility of ECG compression techniques using neural networks.

AB  - A decision the method is presented using the synthetic analysis of the cause and injury extent of transformer malfunction. The identification order is directed downward such that each leaf serves as a malfunction scenario. While each branch corresponds to different artificial neural network (ANN), a multi-resolution identification of transformer malfunction can thus be constructed. Convergence of ANN and accuracy of diagnosis are improved.

AB  - A neural network approach is proposed to search for a centrifugal compressor diffuser blade profile with a prescribed velocity distribution on its surface. The applied neural networks have a four layered feed-forward structure. Blade profiles were determined via aerodynamic computation by constructing parameters such as the inlet and outlet diameter, the blade inlet and outlet angles, the height and the blade numbers. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver was then applied to find the velocity distribution on the blade surface. The results were used with the help of the standard BP algorithm to tune neural networks. The new approach is validated through the design of a diffuser with two-dimensional blade profile. Desired blade profile and velocity distribution are obtained.

AB  - This paper presents a review on the current development of stability control in flexible AC transmission systems from three aspects: mathematical models, installation locations and control strategies. Mathematical models of FACTS devices are described according to their working principles. Various methods of selecting FACTS' installation locations are discussed, and two novel tools are proposed - Normal Form technique and sensitivity analysis using EEAC theory. Applications of nonlinear control and artificial intelligence in FACTS controller design are also expounded. It is pointed out that the key of FACTS synthetic intelligent controller design is the quantitative analysis technique of power system stability.

AB  - Through research on a decision tree algorithm and its improvements, especially the basic algorithm of ID3, their deficiencies, such as overfitting in ID3, were pointed out, and a solution of using fuzzy concept to solve the overfitting was proposed here. A concrete algorithm of fuzzy decision tree was presented here by combining the tree's depth-first algorithm, fuzzy subsethood and ambiguity measure and applied to the gate designing of injection mould. The FDT algorithm has three advantages: (1) it gets less amount of knowledge and more effective knowledge than the traditional algorithms do under the same precision; (2) it significantly avoids the possibility of knowledge explosion in its combination in the knowledge-based engineering design system; (3) the more we use it in application, the more important and more useful knowledge the algorithm will be focused on.

AB  - It has proved through a counter-example that the postulate system for package contractions in the AGM belief revision theory is not consistent. By modifying the postulates for package contractions, some evident defects in original system were removed. It has also proved that if the package contraction function satisfies the modified postulates, it will be a maximum chosen package contraction function. Even though the evident defect is eliminated, a more profound paradox still exists in the modified system. The relation between the package contraction and generalized contraction was given in order to show that the former can be partially defined and substituted by the latter.

AB  - It is important to apply the concept of causation to the model-based diagnosis. The concept of generalized causal theory that contains more information was proposed. It is pointed out that the diagnostic space of the generalized causal theory is less than or equal to that of the corresponding simple causal theory. The theory was applied to the testing area. It has been demonstrated that for closed generalized causal theory, the abductive differential diagnosis is equivalent to the consistency-based differential diagnosis.

AB  - Image Database (IDB) is a combination of the traditional database and the image processing techniques. An intelligent retrieval method of image database, which is guided by artificial intelligence, is presented. Pattern recognition and image processing techniques, heuristic knowledge are all taken into consideration in this method. This method uses an image feature vector to represent an image and builds a retrieval tree of the image base through clustering to seek the optimal image with best-first search for users on it. How to obtain a heuristic evaluation function by using expert's experience and sample training is focused on. These conditions for the existence of evaluation function is presented as well.

AB  - Fluid withdrawal rate is a continuous function of water injection parameters, formation parameters and other parameters in the water injection development period. For this reason, the description of individual-well attitude and the prediction of individual-well fluid withdrawal rate by artificial neural network were discussed. The injection-production system of a tract in certain oilfield is composed of 5 oil wells and 10 water injection wells. The artificial neural network model established in this paper was exercised by the injection-production data in 12 months. The result shows that the complicated functional relationship between fluid withdrawal rate and injected water volume can be quantitatively described by artificial neural network. The method can be used for the description of waterflooding attitude. The result of rolling prediction shows that the predicted accumulative oil production coincides with the measured result.

AB  - The forming pressure of the liquid extrusion process is influenced by many factors, including the pouring temperature, the die temperature, the delay period, the pressing velocity, and so on. So it is very difficult to determine the value of the deforming pressure correctly. In this paper, a new method for deforming pressure prediction has been introduced, which is developed on the basis of the three layers of back-propagation neural network. The result show that the calculated values are well identical with the experimental ones.

AB  - A new apporach in improving traditional methods of control is presented. The paper tries to collect relevant expert knowledge and experiences of operators, and puts forward an intelligent control scheme. To compensate for the disadvantages in traditional control methods in their inability to adapt to the wide fluctuations in boiler load, it comes up with a rule-based expert control method. To obviate difficulties in finding an optimum control, it presents a simple but practical method of steady wind-to-coal balance based on experiences. The method has been applied in actual cases, showing that it is practical. It increased the efficiency of combustion, comparing better than traditional control methods.

AB  - The development and study of the expert system (ES) is still an active branch in the artificial intelligence field (AI). Many successful expert systems are being applied to different departments and enterprises and have produced good social and economic efficiency. But in some engineering fields, a single expert system can not finish complex and comprehensive tasks. Just because people can not understand enough our study objects on a level and a single expert who has a special knowledge in a field can not finish a comprehensive task, people need a group of experts in different fields to solve complex and comprehensive problems with their hard work. At present, there are few models to solve these common complex and comprehensive problems, thus a kind of cooperation system model for universal model is introduced. The principle and methods of cooperation expert system are discussed in this paper. Taking the petroleum completion methods as examples, the designed principle and methods about cooperation-expert system of completion methods in a completion project are studied. The contents about the description driver structure knowledge expression act of the cooperation expert system are also discussed in the paper. With this theory, the study range of expert system (ES) can be expanded and the development of artificial intelligence (AI) improved.

AB  - It is believed that agile manufacturing is the twenty-first century manufacturing enterprise strategy and should be realized by agile virtual enterprise (AVE) which is dynamically configured for the manufacturing of one or more products. Agile manufacturing creates a significant challenge for the partner selection in configuring an AVE. This paper presents a brief introduction to the task decomposition for the manufacturing of a product in multisite environment. A bidding process should be carried out for each task so as to get the information necessary for the configuration of AVE. To minimize the manufacturing cost, an integer programming (IP) formulation is presented for the partner selection problem. The IP formulation is then transformed into a graph-theoretical formulation by taking the advantage of the precedence relationship between the tasks. The graph obtained turns out to be a directed multipartite graph. Based on the graph-theoretical formulation, an efficient solution algorithm is proposed for the problem. It is shown that the algorithm is polynomial bounded. Therefore, it is applicable to large practical problems.

AB  - Development of computational agent organizations or "societies" has become the domiant computing paradigm in the arena of Distributed Artificial Intelligence, and many foreseeable future applications need agent organizations, in which diversified agents cooperate in a distributed manner, forming teams. In such scenarios, the agents would need to know each other in order to facilitate the interactions. Moreover, agents in such an environment are not statically defined in advance but they can adaptively enter and leave an organization. This begs the question of how agents locate each other in order to cooperate in achieving organizational goals. Locating agents is a quite challenging task, especially in organizations that involve a large number of agents and where the resource avaiability is intermittent. The authors explore here an approach based on self-organization map (SOM) which will serve as a clustering method in the light of the knowledge gathered about various agents. The approach begins by categorizing agents using a selected set of agent properties. These categories are used to derive various ranks and a distance matrix. The SOM algorithm uses this matrix as input to obtain clusters of agents. These clusters reduce the search space, resulting in a relatively short agent search time.

AB  - Based on the genetic algorithms (GAs), an automatic design and optimizing method called GMNN (Genetic Multilayer Neural Network) for feedforward multilayer neural networks is put forward. Based on the analysis of historical structure design methods of neural networks, the special genetic encoding representations are discussed, and a fitness function is defined also. Some special genetic operations are designed according to the problem. In addition, simulated annealing algorithms, BP algorithms and niche technology is also used to accelerate the convergence rate and improve the generalization of the solution. The elementary results of the experiments indicate that this method can find the satisfied network comparatively fast and the generalization performance of the network that we got is good. In the process of the software development, Java language is adopted considering the underlying parallel of the GAs and neural networks, and the realizing methods of parallel evolution neural networks are discussed also.

AB  - ROCSAT-1 is the first small satellite developed by the Republic of China and is a low-earth orbit experimental satellite. The goal of ROCSAT-1 is to carry out scientific research missions. To successfully accomplish ROCSAT missions, the ROCSAT Mission Operations Team (RMOT) is formed to handle the daily operation and maintenance activities. These activities are onerous and complex. Hence, RMOT is concerned with future personnel training. In this paper, we propose an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) which is capable of integrating the training courses into a software program. ITS uses a great amount of information to present a subject for a user to learn. In the process of teaching, an ITS is capable of presenting the course materials in a structured format to the user and to judge if the user has mastered the subject or not. ITS is the tool to integrate the RMOT training courses and to develop a multi-function computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system. It can not only provide a practical method for users recurrently, but also make self-teaching easily.

AB  - Cushioning packaging is the most important subject in theoretical studies and real world applications of packaging dynamics. One of the fundamental steps in the design of cushioning packaging is to choose appropriate cushioning liner materials so as to control the peak value of acceleration transfered to the product and avoid the damage of the product resulting from the excessive internal stress owing to a large inertia force. It is necessary to determine the nonlinear behaviours of cushioning liners for designing reasonably packaging items and improving the cushioning effect of the packaging of products. It gives a new way of providing theoretical basis for judging, demonstrating and designing cushioning packaging that the artificial neural network methods, fuzzy adaptive control techniques and evolutionary computations are used to deal with the identification problems of cushioning packaging. This paper outlines several advances in the identification of nonlinear characteristics of packaging using computational intelligence and discusses the existent problems and the relevant further efforts.

AB  - According to the principle, `The failure data is the basis of software reliability analysis', we built a software reliability expert system (SRES) by adopting the artificial intelligence technology. By reasoning out the conclusion from the fitting results of failure data of a software project, the SRES can recommend users `the most suitable model' as a software reliability measurement model. We believe that the SRES can overcome the inconsistency in applications of software reliability models well. We report investigation results of singularity and parameter estimation methods of experimental models in SRES.

AB  - The innovation graph is deduced from the innovation vector that is formed by the difference of measurement vector and predictive vector. The method is the combination of innovation vector and graph theory. The innovation graph is valuable to identify bad data and topology errors. The present innovation vector does not reflect the inner relationship among the elements of the stipulations of an agreement innovation vector. In this paper the definition of the innovation graph reflecting their inner relationship is given and the artificial intelligent characteristics are described from the views of the epistemology and the methodology. This project is supported by the State Key Laboratory of Power System in Tsinghua University of China.

AB  - This paper proposes and illustrates an AI embedded object-oriented methodology to formulate the computable general equilibrium (CGE) models. In this framework, a CGE model is viewed as a collection of objects embedded AI or namely agents in computer world, corresponding to economic agents and entities in real world, such as government, households, markets and so on. A frame representation of major objects in CGE model is used for trade and environment. Embedded AI object-oriented approach (or software agent) is used in the CGE model representation can able to narrow the gap among the semantic representation, formal CGE (mathematical) representation and computer and algorithm representation, and to improve CGE in understanding and maintenance etc. In such a system, constructing a CGE model to appear an intuitive process rather than an abstract process. This intuitive process needs more understanding of the substance of economics and the logic underlying the problem rather than mathematical notation.

AB  - With the comparison of multiple power system transient stability assessment (TSA) methods, a new hierarchical TSA scheme based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques is proposed. Realization of the scheme with the application of both rule-based reasoning and artificial neural networks, and digital simulation test results are presented with an example of 7-machine 24-bus power system. The sample-based input features screening is also discussed in detail. The new scheme avoids time-consuming digital simulation and can provide multi-level stability information, including the stability levels, the leading instability generator or generator group and the fault critical clearing time (CCT) for dangerous cases. This project is jointly supported by `artificial intelligence based power system stability margin on-line assessment and preventive control' (Guangdong Ph.D Foundation, No. 974112) and `intelligent power system stability assessment and enhancement' (Croucher Foundation).

AB  - First, the concept of cooperative conflict is presented, and the characteristic of cooperative air combat is researched. Then, four methods of conflict resolution are designed by way of the first order predicate logic, i.e., link-up, coordination, accommodation and integration, and corresponding examples are given. A 2 vs 2 air combat simulation was carried out; after conflict resolution, the loss ratio is dropped to 0.54 from the original 1.32, so the enhancement of effectiveness is notable. The present research findings are that the wide conflicts discover the essence of multi-fighter cooperation, i.e., to as fully as possible enhance the effectiveness of each fighter to attain global optimization, and that the possibility of conflict resolution shows the application prospect. The proposed method in this paper is a helpful try to the application of the Fifth Generation Computer in the new generation of C3I system.

AB  - Based on the Gabor function model of simple cortical cells, by imitating the structure of orientation columns in the visual cortex, and aided by the pattern enhancement and processing nets, a model for edge detection with neuron-like organization is constructed. Simulation results show that its detection capability is comparable to that of the advanced edge detection algorithms of the smoothing-spacial differentiation type in vogue. It is shown that this model as intuitively based on the early concept of edge detectors is essentially identical to the latter in the detection mechanism. The proposed model provides a prototype for edge detection using electronic-optical techniques and artificial neural nets.

AB  - A constitutive model for a rock mass with intermittent joints and with an evolution equation for the propagation of secondary cracks at joint tips is proposed in this paper using fracture mechanics and damage mechanics. The principle of dynamic construction mechanics of a rock mass is described. The principles of dynamic programming and artificial intelligence techniques, as well as the above mentioned mechanical models, are used to perform optimizing analysis for the construction scheme of a group of chambers for a large water-conservancy project. The results show that the optimizing analysis is effective. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A field theory based adaptive resonance neural network model, FTART2, is proposed. FTART2 combines the advantages of the adaptive resonance theory and the field theory, and achieves fast learning, strong generality and high efficiency. Moreover,FTART2 can adaptively adjust its network topology, so that the disadvantage of manually configuring hidden neurons of traditional feed-forward networks is avoided. Benchmark tests show that FTART2 achieves higher accuracy and faster speed than standard BP.

AB  - To study the capacity of artificial neural network (ANN) applying to battlefield target classification and result of classification, according to the characteristics of battlefield target acoustic and seismic signals, an on-the-spot experiment was carried out to derive acoustic and seismic signals of a tank and jeep by special experiment system. Experiment data processed by fast Fourier transform (FFT) were used to train the ANN to distinguish the two battlefield targets. The ANN classifier was performed by the special program base on the modified backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The ANN classifier has high correct identification rates for acoustic and seismic signals of battlefield targets, and is suitable for the classification of battlefield targets. The modified BP algorithm eliminates oscillations and local minimum of the standard BP algorithm, and enhances the convergence rate of the ANN.

AB  - The visual cortex consists of layers of neural cells. The cells, specifically the simple and complex cells, are arranged in a very orderly way. They are organized in narrow columns that cut across the layers of the cortex, each column continuing responds best when a specific visual image projected on the retina. In the language of pattern recognition, they work as feature extraction units. The architecture and mechanism of natural biological system, which processing visual image, are taken as a model for the development of artificial electrical system. The ANN algorithms are used to train the network for the acquisition of sensitivity to special feature. All these research are of great significance for knowledge representation, pattern recognition and computer vision, which are based on cognitive neuropsychology.

AB  - Commonsense and temporal reasoning are two main research topics in artificial intelligence. Temporal reasoning proposed by Allen and others lacks a unified representative network about time point, interval and duration, overemphasizes computation while lacking rule inference, is difficult to apply in multiagent setting, and does not consider inconsistency in commonsense. In this paper, the authors present a unified representative network about time information, analyze the inference rules among constraints, and propose the multiagent cooperative method satisfying weak path consistency to solve commonsense temporal task. The work of this paper improves the work of Meiri as well as that of Wetprasit and Sattar, provides viable scheme for temporal reasoning to combine commonsense property and to fit the cooperative multiagent setting.

AB  - Having no distinctly guided tendency is one of the main weaknesses of Evolutionary Algorithms. In reference to the individuals' life periodicity, an ecological evolution model guided by life period is proposed. In the model, the guiding sectors are set up at each phase of the life period, and the individuals' evolution is guided by their ecological features within the whole life period. The experimental results show the model's effectiveness.

AB  - Intentions, an integral part of the mental state of an agent, play an important role in determining the behavior of rational agents. There are several models of intention based on normal modal logic. But these theories suffer from a serious omniscience problem. It is argued that intention is not a normal modal operator, and another intention model is presented. It doesn't have the logical omniscience problem and other related problems such as side-effect problem, etc.. Compared with Konolige and Pollack's model of intention, this model is not only simpler and more natural, but also satisfies the K-axiom and the Joint Consistency. Actually it gives a new method for semantic representation of non-normal modal operators based on normal possible worlds.

AB  - The application of granularity theory in the domain of layout-design problem solving was discussed. A layout algorithm based on the multi-granularity model was proposed by adopting strategies of both constraint-problem solving and backtracking. The constraints were not sufficiently used in previous layout algorithms because they usually adopted singular granularity model that was either too raw to let design process go further or too fine to cut search branches earlier, thus the complexity was inevitable. In the proposed algorithm, a multi-granularity model was adopted and constraints of different design periods could be used in the algorithm. Hence the drawbacks of former approaches were overcome. A case study in a house layout problem was carefully analyzed using the algorithm.

AB  - The application of granularity theory in layout design modeling was discussed. A layout model based on granularity theory was proposed by integrating agency graph, normal constraint graph and hierarchical constraint graph as its components, and a mapping rule method was also presented. This model overcomes the drawbacks of models in single granularity that cannot fully express constraints and need spending large amount of effort during search. The mapping rule method assures the convenient transmission of the construct and information among different granularity worlds, and guarantees their consistence after transmission.

AB  - The least mean square (LMS) iterative algorithm is used to improve the blind symbol estimation method that is based on subspace. These results in the drastic reduction of computational work compared with the conventional one. So the improved method is suitable for realizing uplink signals separation in smart antenna systems. The computer simulation has shown that the improved method has the same effect as the conventional one.

AB  - The three variables of the electric characteristic of human auricular points can be regarded as observed targets that reflect the physiologic or pathologic changes. Medical principle design follows the theory of the channels and collaterals and the viscera-state doctrine of traditional Chinese medicine and that of the pattern recognition. The linear integration model can be established by drawing the characterisitc variables of the correlation groups of the auricular points and applying the multi-variable normalization. With this model, the recognition of the three variations of the auricular points can be of use for differential diagnosis. In this paper, the test to identify the cases of Upper-Digestive tract achieves good result. This research, based on the integration of modern science with traditional Chinese medicine, provides a method for building the specialist system of the auricular point diagnosis, and probably has some prospect in clinical application.

AB  - In order to overcome the effect of the complexity of real plants and enhance the generalization and precision of the mathematical model, a simulation method integrating the basic condenser model with artificial neural network is presented. The basic counterflow condenser model is constructed by a steady state distributed-parameter model and a corresponding stable algorithm for the counterflow condenser based on the phase change and the iterative calculation of refrigerant enthalpy at exit. The trend of the simulation results is in accord with that of the experimental data and can reflect the basic qualitative characteristic of the real physical process. Through learning partial experimental data by BP algorithm, a multi-layer artificial neural network is established and integrated with the counterflow condenser model. The nonlinear mapping ability of the artificial neural network is utilized to modify the counterflow condenser model and to improve its predicting results. It shows that this method is an effective way to improve the generalization and precision of the general condenser model.

AB  - It is demonstrated that the logic tool used in agent formalized depiction should be the mixed modal logic which has both normal and non-normal modal operators. Then a logic system A-BI is built for Agent-BDI logic and its semantics and axiom system are discussed. Especially for non-normal modal operators a new semantic interpretation based on Kripke's normal possible worlds is presented. It is proved that A-BI logic system is sound and complete. A-BI logic appropriately depicts the essence and relation of belief and intention, and can be used as logic tool in formalized research on agent.

AB  - H. Bezzazi, D. Makinson and R. Pino Perez discussed a number of non-Horn rules that were stronger or incomparable with rational monotony. They established a representation theorem for P+RM+WD and P+RM+RC. Their results led to the open question of representation theorems for the weaker postulate sets P+RC and P+WD. This paper presents two new kind of preferential models called valuation-ranked preferential model and PRC model, and establishes the representation theorems for P+RC and P+WD in the framework of finite propositional logic in terms of valuation-ranked preferential model and PRC model respectively. Finally, it gives negative answer for another open problem posed by H. Bezzazi, D. Makinson and R. Pino.

AB  - A novel fast soft-decision decoding algorithm, called variable-threshold Chase algorithm (VTC), is described. The set of test patterns is fast produced by using A* algorithm, then is partitioned into the equivalence classes. During the partition, the equivalence class representatives can be generated. A variable threshold is derived for optimality test on a candidate codeword. With set partition and optimality test, a fast soft-decision decoding algorithm is obtained. Simulation results show the advantage of the proposed algorithm over soft-decision decoding algorithms available is much faster decoding speed without loss of decoding performance.

AB  - Some problems plaguing the current researches on social norms for agent are pointed out in this paper. By importing Coleman's foundations of social theory, a social norm conception based on rights allocation is proposed. The assumption of average rights allocation in Coleman's theory is relaxed, a formal definition for social norms in multi-agent system is given, and the design of a norm as a constraint satisfaction problem is derived. Then the rationality of social norms is investigated, and the conditions for social norm's constitution and abolition are given. Finally, the rationality property of social norms under symmetrical interest situation is investigated and a value equalization algorithm that can improve the rationality property of a norm is given. The work may contribute to the researches on market-oriented multi-agent system.

AB  - As a knowledge representation framework and a kind of probability inference engine, Bayesian networks are widely used in applications for reasoning and decision making with inherent uncertainty. Since the exact algorithms of probability inference in Bayesian networks is NP-hard, as the topology of the network becomes more dense, the run-time complexity of probabilistic inference increases dramatically and real-time decision making eventually becomes prohibitive, so many approximate algorithms based on simulation or model simplification are proposed. The method discussed in this paper is based on the model simplification of arc removal. In this method, a subset of arcs are selected and removed, which simplifies the network structure and we obtain an approximate network, then any probability inference algorithm can be applied to this approximate network to get a solution within the error bound we predefined. By using the Kullback-Leibler information divergence as the measure of the difference between two probability distributions, this paper discusses the multiple arc removal problem in the general case and presents the optimal parameters for the approximate network. Finally, a heuristic algorithm is provided which searches a set of arcs to be removed under the upper bound on the probability error allowed.

AB  - A new random CSP (constraint satisfaction problem) model is proposed. By analyzing the expected number of nodes in a search tree, the average running time used by the backtracking algorithm on random constraint satisfaction problems is studied. The results show that the model can generate hard CSP instances, and the expected number of nodes required for finding all solutions or proving that no solution exists becomes exponentially large as the number of variables grows. Therefore, the model can be used to analyze the nature of hard instances and evaluate the performance of CSP algorithms, and hence it helps the researchers to design more efficient algorithms.

AB  - A method for modeling the learning of belief combination in evidential reasoning using a neural network is presented. A centralized network composed of multiple improved exponential bidirectional associative memories (Multi-IeBAM) sharing a single output array of neurons is proposed to process the uncertainty management of many pieces of evidence simultaneously. The stability of the proposed Multi-IeBAM network is proved. A majority rule of decision making in presentation of multiple evidence is also found by the study of signal-noise-ratio of multiple IeBAM networks. The theoretical analysis and computer simulations indicate that the majority factor of Multi-IeBAM is tighter and stricter than that of Multi-MeBAM and Multi-eBAM, which grants that experts could still reach the right decision under a certain degree of disturbance in evidence. The result of simulation analysis given in the end is coincident with the intuition of reasoning.

On this basis, as a result of our research work, we have built a new dynamic load-balancing model named as Periodical Load Rebalancing Model (PLRM) based on Java. We introduce agent technology to strengthen the host-host communication during re-balancing. As a result, the work of load balancing can be made more accurate and efficient. The final target of our work is to research how balancing should work in large-scale ubiquitous problem domain.

AB  - In building larger network information system, efficient management and transmission of huge information are important in several reasons. Firstly, the system will be driven into confusion without a perfect information management strategy faced with tremendous amount of information resources. Secondly, it is essential for the system to transmit huge information in a secure and efficient way in widely networking environment. Furthermore, the system with excellent compatibility and extensibility will be valuable on account of system maintenance and update. In this paper, we propose a solution of a flexible distributed information delivery system DID to resolve those problems, which is based on the technique of software agent and CORBA. The design and implementation of DID system are described in detail.

AB  - The weldability of aluminum-alloy 508 for DC spot welding is studied by the use of DC spot welder and dynamic parameter testing system. On the basis of technical testing, a discrete ANN model for quality prediction and evaluation of spot welding is built. The results show that the reflection from input vector space to output vector space could be realized by discrete processing on the input and output parameters of prediction model, such as welding current, voltage between electrodes and shearing strength. The prediction model has good reliability and fault-tolerance. It is adapted to predict and evaluate weld quality for DC spot welding of aluminum, and can be used to realize intelligent manufacturing of resistance spot welding.

It turns the problem of differential game into the problem of maneuver identification and optimization control based on neural networks. This process of solving differential games is more conformity with practice, and provides an efficient method for adding human experience and combining the qualitative analysis with quantitative analysis of differential game. The adaptive distributed learning rate of neural networks is developed to increase the learning speed and performance greatly.

AB  - A method of implementing intelligent control of inverted pendulum by the use of cloud models is expatiated upon in this paper. Its control strategy needs no mathematical models of plant but human experience, sensation and logic decision. The control experience qualitatively expressed by linguistic value is transformed into the linguistic control rulers through linguistic atoms and cloud models, so that non-linear and uncertain problems can be disposed of. The practicability and effectiveness of the control method have been proved by the inverted pendulum called typical plant. The experiment results demonstrate that the method has stronger robustness against the variation of states and parameters of plants, and that it has better practicing value and widely prospect.

AB  - In recent years, multi-agent based distributed software systems have been applied successfully in many fields. We present a structure of the diagnostic prototype system based on the diagnostic task sets. In this paper, several multi-agent based distributed task decomposition and control problems of fault diagnosis are discussed. Different from other applied fields, the diagnostic task of the distributed facility uses decomposition methods based on the structure and faults of the diagnosed objects. By these methods, the diagnostic task tree model is established. And this paper presents the serial, parallel and hybrid strategies of the diagnostic task control in the multi-agent-based fault diagnosis system. In final, the coordination and collaboration problems between diagnostic agents have been described. We find that the fault diagnosis system based on multi agents is more effective than the traditional knowledge-based system. © 2001 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to fault diagnosis of valves in three-cylinder reciprocating pumps. Since the vibration signals collected from pumps apparently show the existence of non-stationary signals and the interference of neighboring valves, the wavelet packet transform is introduced as a preprocessing means of extracting time-frequency information from vibration signals to obtain the fault characteristics of the valves. Furthermore, to reduce the dimensions of the character vectors and extract diagnosis rules of the faulty valves, a rough set based intelligence diagnostic system is constructed and used in the valve faults diagnosis. It is proved that fault types and positions can be identified and diagnosed by the above method.

AB  - A simulation model of a natural circulation boiler evaporation system is presented, which is based on neural network (NN) and process mechanism characteristics. The main characteristic of the model is that it is the hybrid artificial neural network (HANN) model, thus its ideal simulation speed is assured. On network model design, the system and the physical basis of the network between input and output were well considered. The network model was transformed from black box model to gray box model to a certain degree. Compared with ordinary ANN, the training of this network model fully reflects physical mechanism learning on system input and output, besides basic function of learning pure numeric mapping relations between input and output. Therefore, the association ability, the prediction ability and the extrapolation effect on system transition process of the network model were well assured. At the same time, on-line modeling of boiler evaporation system can be realized by using the simulation method. This model strengthens the description capability on real system. The validity of the modeling method was proved by the simulation test result.

AB  - Rhombus thinking, a new creative thinking method, is the combination of divergent thinking process and convergent thinking process, in which qualitative analysis is carried out before quantitative analysis. This method tries to solve the bottle neck problem in intelligent CAD based on the extension theory. The rhombus thinking method to the scheme design of new products is applied. In this process, firstly, the matter-element expression for the know information are set up, and then a set of matter-elements are opened up by matter-elements extension method; Finally, the useful information are got by appraisal method of dependent degree. It has been successfully applied to the scheme design for the cutter-store of machining center. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrated that the method is much more accurate, objective and efficient than the traditional one.

AB  - Silicon content in pig iron has long been used as one of the most important indices to represent the thermal state of a blast furnace. In this paper, a predictive system for blast furnaces by integrating a neural network with qualitative analysis is presented. The qualitative trend of the process in blast furnace is predicted through causal analysis and qualitative reasoning, and the relevant variables as the inputs of a neural network model are determined. Then, a neural network model is constructed and trained with appropriate data. Evaluation of the system is made by comparing the predicted values with observed data (totally 610 heats are included), and the performance of the system is excellent.

AB  - Based on ID3 (Identification data) method which is a kind of pattern recognition, an electric power transformer fault diagnosis method was proposed. As ID3 method can handle the nonnumerical value feature patterns and has the function that can learn decision rules from samples, the application of the proposed method to some realistic samples shows that ID3 method is suitable for transformer fault diagnosis. The advantages of the proposed method, as compared to the other methods using artificial intelligence such as artificial neural networks and expert system, were described. The combination of ID3 method with other artificial intelligent method is an effective way for the practical fault diagnosis of electric power transformer.

AB  - A classifying method on bulk blue ballpoint pen ink has been studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. By using this method, a total of 108 blue ink samples have been divided into two groups depending on their main component. Spectral characteristics of these inks such as frequency and absorbance are described by way of artificial intelligence of pattern recognition, and 35 subgroups from the 108 inks are distinguished by their correlation coefficient (??). Under heat or exposure to ultraviolet light a mode of change in the age of the inks has been obtained. This approach has provided a reliable and nondestructive method for the characterization of bulk ballpoint writing ink, and more importantly, it might be a basis for dating of the blue ballpoint pen ink.

AB  - An intelligent motion planning based on fuzzy rules for the idea of artificial potential fields using analytic harmonic functions is presented. The purpose of the combination of a fuzzy controller and a robust controller is to design a realistic controller for nonlinear electromechanical systems such as an electric motor actuating an arm robot. This control algorithm is applied to the three basic navigation problems of intelligent robot systems in unstructured environments: autonomous planning, fast nonstop navigation without collision with obstacles, and dealing with structured and/or unstructured uncertainties. To achieve this degree of independence, the robot system needs a variety of sensors to be able to interact with the real world. Sonar range data is used to build a description of the robot's surroundings. The proposed approach is simple, computationally fast, and applies to whole-arm collision avoidance. The stability of the overall closed loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. Simulation results are provided to validate the theoretical concepts, and a comparative analysis demonstrates the benefits of the proposed obstacle avoidance algorithm.

AB  - Traditional researches on the similitude between entities are excessively simplified and lack of intent. Firstly a detailed analysis on the analogical relationship between entities is made, which concerns about not only the common attributes, but also the redundant and conflicting attributes of analogical entities, and it is explained from the point of view of extensive pertinence. Secondly different extensive similitudes are defined based on different decision-making principles, which coincide with different demands in decision-making circumstance. Finally a set of generalized logical operator combination rules in analogical reasoning is proposed, therefore this proposal remedies the limitation of invariable operation rule in conventional analogical reasoning.

AB  - A simulation and analysis system of accident reconstruction is developed in this paper. Considering the great difference between accident types, the technique of artificial intelligence is used to develop the models, which rely on different parameter subsets from those adopted in other systems. And the model assumption is based on the characteristics of the given accident type. The demonstration module of three-dimensional animation is developed using the technique of virtual reality and OpenGL interface. The vehicle motion is demonstrated in the virtual world, and the scene elements can be easily changed to fit the real scene. A vehicle parameter database is also developed, and a real accident case is analyzed and simulated with both this system and PC-CRASH. The result of this system basically agrees with that of PC-CRASH system.

AB  - Based on the consideration of nonlinear mapping between rain attenuation and compositions of various parameters such as frequency, elevation angle, rain-fall rate, polarization angle and so on, this paper proposed a new rain attenuation predication model of millimeter wave. The predicted results of the model were compared with that of the CCIR model. The results show that applying the artificial neural network to predict rain attenuation of high frequency wave decreases the mean prediction error by 0.59 dB and the root of mean square error by 0.69 dB.

AB  - Non zero-sum Markov game and reinforcement learning based on Q-algorithm is a feasible frame for the research on the mechanism of multiagent system's cooperation. In fact, the independent learning is focused on individual agent regardless of other agents' actions under this frame. So, the cooperative mechanism is deficient. And, it is over idealized that the perfect observed information is required when agents are interacting with environment. A cooperated learning under joined action and imperfect information was proposed for solving these two problems. Convergence of the improved algorithm was proved.

AB  - Model selection is an important component of model management system for decision support systems (DSS). A crucial problem for users of DSS is that the present methods of model selection require the users too much. The users are required to have a profound understanding of the models in the model base and the problems with them. This leads to the poor feasibility of model selection. The article presents the theory and the method for automatic selection of model based on integration of expert system with artificial neural networks, which is divided into model class selection and model structure selection - the use of an expert system technology to select model class and the use of an artificial neural network for automatic selection of model structure. The artificial neural network method consists of learning and working in particular.

AB  - The BP algorithm proposed for neural networks is discussed, which made the neural networks for practical use since the neural networks has not been applied properly because the user failed to stress the pretreatment of input data to the neural networks. An improved Cauchy method to normalize input data in the light of the characters of spacecraft and methods of constructing normalization functions are proposed. The comparison results of these methods show that normalization is the key reason on the correctness of faults diagnosis in spacecraft.

An appropriate topological structure of ANN was presented. The predicted information about blending diesel oil can be successfully obtained. The average errors of predicted SP and CFPP were 1.05° and 0.91°C, respectively. The ANN model can predict both SP and CFPP more accurately than the blending coefficient model, index correlation model, and the SP conversion factor model.

AB  - In view of the clustering phenomenon of natural language as well as the demand for dynamic alternation of knowledge architecture, a dynamic knowledge extraction method based on sentence-clustering recognition is put forward in this paper. First of all, the paper gives a research framework of the proposed method, which describes the transformation process from natural language texts to object-oriented knowledge architecture. Some problems related to sentence vectorization are investigated. Several fundamental definitions as well as one judgment theorem are given, and the postpositional processing on attribute vectors of sentence cells is discussed. A sentence-clustering recognition approach is constructed using ART2 neural network and the concept of prior belief degree is adopted to measure the outcome of sentence recognition. A simulation procedure of ART2 neural network is compiled by Matlab. The effects of sentence recognition by the procedure are given, and the corresponding analysis is made. A width-first code-generating method is proposed so as to make knowledge transformation for the clustered sentences according to the outcome of sentence recognition by ART2 neural network, and the posterior belief degree is defined as a final evaluation index to sentence recognition and semantic model construction. The implementation steps of the above method are further introduced for a specific sentence pattern. Finally, the derived relation is generated by utilizing the new approach of structural modeling proposed by the authors, so that the knowledge extraction process from natural language texts to object-oriented knowledge architecture can be accomplished. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a practical example of mechanical CAD, which is adopted to penetrate the whole paper so as to demonstrate the complete implementation details.

AB  - As a common method to train multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks in the simulation of refrigeration systems, the standard BP algorithm is lack of efficiency and adaptive capacity. So, it should be substituted by an improved BP algorithm. After analysis and comparison, the method of linear expansion of MLP's outputs with respect to learning rate was selected to optimize the learning rate adaptively, and the BFGS variable metric method was selected to tune the weights. The BFGS method is improved partly to deal with a possible case in which a denominator in BFGS formula becomes zero. Taking the experimental data of thermodynamic performance of refrigeration systems as training samples, the training course were compared, which use the standard BP algorithm, the steepest descent algorithm with learning rate optimization, and the BFGS algorithm with learning rate optimization, respectively. The results show that the BFGS algorithm with the learning rate optimization has the advantages of high learning efficiency, high approximation precision and good adaptive capacity.

AB  - How to increase both autonomy and versatility of a knowledge discovery system is a core problem and a crucial aspect of KDD (Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining). Within the framework of the KDD process and the GLS (Global Learning Scheme) system recently proposed by us, this paper describes a way of increasing both autonomy and versatility of a KDD system by dynamically organizing KDD processes. In our approach, the KDD process is modeled as an organized society of KDD agents with multiple levels. We propose an ontology to describe KDD agents, in the style of OOER (Object Oriented Entity Relationship) data model. Based on this ontology of KDD agents, we apply several AI planning techniques, which are implemented as a meta-agent, so that we might (1) solve the most difficult problem in a multiagent KDD system: how to automatically choose appropriate KDD techniques (KDD agents) to achieve a particular discovery goal in a particular application domain; (2) tackle the complexity of KDD process; and (3) support evolution of KDD data, knowledge and process. The GLS system, as a multistrategy and multiagent KDD system based on the methodology, increases both autonomy and versatility.

AB  - A new concept named computational comminution is proposed in this paper, which is different from the traditional studies on materials processing procedure such as the study based on theoretic models, the study based on experiment models, which is based on information models. Some key technologies applied to materials processing procedure such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy sets, genetic algorithms and visualization technology are also presented, and a fusing methodology of these new technologies is studied. Application in the cement grinding process of Horomill shows that results in this paper are efficient.

AB  - Case-based design (CBD) is the application of case-based reasonning (CBR) to the design process. There are two problems that hindered the application of CBD. One problem lies in the modification process. Due to the fact that knowledge acqusitition is still the bottleneck of the design process, this paper proposes that modification should be done by designers, rather than by machines directly and thoroughly. And the machine inference results can be used as suggestion to designers in the modification. Another problem relates to case evolution and customization. The paper proposes the agile case template technique and the user's template technique that overcome the problem perfectly. Case formalization that is helpful to case indexing is also discussed.

AB  - This paper studies the scheduling of design projects in concurrent development process with uncertain number of feedback revisions. An optimization based methodology that combines heuristic algorithm, artificial intelligence (fuzzy, genetic algorithm) and scheduling theory is developed. In the algorithm, weighting values of some key factors are defined by genetic algorithm. In addition, fuzzy logic is used to decide the ability coefficients of different roles taken by designers. Moreover, the process of pre-release and feedback revision is realized. Simulation example is a fraction of practical development project, and satisfied results are obtained.

AB  - Although the application of multilayer perceptron (MLP) to the simulation of thermodynamic performance of refrigeration compressors can produce better results than conventional thermodynamic models, there are still some problems with it. In this paper, MLP is substituted by a radial basis function (RBF) network, which solves these problems successfully. The simulation illustrates the effectiveness of RBF method presented here and its superiority to the MLP method.

AB  - Agent-based computing represents an exciting new hot point in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and more generally, computer science. Autonomous agents and multi-agent systems represent a new way of analyzing, designing, and implementing complex software systems. Agent are being used in an increasingly wide variety of applications. In this paper an architecture of Multi-Agent system based forecasting support system (MAFSS) is presented, which shows how the agents are organized in order to provide the system's overall behavior. It is composed of eight different types of agents. Each agent in MAFSS performs its own function, and can also work jointly with others.

AB  - The principles and strategies of voltage and reactive power control (VQC) for substations, as well as the existing problems and implementation modes are discussed. In this paper the new "nine-area control strategy", based on the artificial intelligent technologies, is introduced. Several current voltage/var control modes are also compared. Furthermore a new "half-independent" voltage/var control mode is presented, which uses the information collected from substation automatic system. It is believed to have wide applications in the near future.

AB  - The principal factors of the position and the motion control parameters of the feed system of a paper cutting machine driven by double-speed braked motors are analyzed using simulation system. The study results show that both the braking torque and the response lag error have a great impact on the position precision and a nonlinear relation ship exists between them. It is demonstrated that the system friction, dump and electricity net voltage have less influence on the position for larger position dimension. The position precision can be limited within 0.03 mm by choosing the optimal control parameters of the control system of the paper cutter.

AB  - New shift schedule and auto-controlling strategy for automatic transmission were proposed from the point of view of saving energy. In order to verify this shift schedule, a simulation program was developed using a software package of Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results show that the shift schedule is correct. The efficiency of the torque converter through shift schedule expressions can be completely limited in an idealized range at any working condition. This shift schedule enriches the theory of vehicle automatic maneuvering and improves the efficiency of hydrodynamic drive system of vehicle.

AB  - Experience is an important source of knowledge for intelligent computer aided design. In this paper, an approach of effectively making use of process experience is proposed. A group of feature based code numbers is assigned to each sheet metal part. This number is sent to an Artificial Neural Network(ANN) that has been trained by forming process samples. The experience of part forming process has been gathered into sample library, so the ANN (BP network) trained by it will learn the knowledge of sheet metal forming. When a new group of feature code numbers of a part is sent to this ANN, it will map generate the feasible forming process. The weight matrix of the trained ANN is called pattern knowledge. Consisted of ANN subsystem, process parameter calculation subsystem and a feature based part modeling subsystem, a framework of intelligent system has been built up to work out the sheet metal part forming process.

AB  - In order to realize the agility of the fixture design, such as reconfigurability, rescalability and reusability, fixture structure is function unit-based decomposed from a fire-new point of view. Which makes it easy for agile fixture to be reconfigured and modified. Thereby, the base of case-based agile fixture design system info is established. Whole case-based agile fixture design model is presented. In which, three modules are added relative to the other models, including case matching of fixture planning module, conflict arbitration module and agile fixture case modify module. The three modules could solve the previous problem that the experience and result are difficult to be reused in the process of design. Two key techniques in the process of the agile fixture design, the evaluation of case similarity, and restriction-based conflict arbitration, are listed. And some methods are presented to evaluate the similarity and clear up the conflict.

AB  - Both the longitudinal and the cross aspects are taken into consideration in the system. From the longitudinal aspect, based on the system engineering and software engineering, we import the three chains of chain-group (decision chain, support chain and main chain), through the whole process of system development and design. From the cross aspect, we think that information integration based on the chain-group can be realized by computer cooperation, artificial intelligence, database technology and so on, each production unit is considered to be a virtual enterprise, and to be described by means of the information that computer can recognize. Some problems such as shift and decompose of a job, intelligent architecture design, data organization and management architecture design and reciprocity of human and system are also discussed.

AB  - An expertise knowledge database is established on the basis of analyses on the static and dynamic geologic data and fracturing parameters obtained from more than 500 wells that have been fractured in sand reservoirs of Zhongyuan oilfield. The single and multi factors and chief parameters which affect fracturing results are analyzed. An artificial intelligent system for selecting targets of hydraulic fracturing is developed by the use of the artificial nerve network technique. Adopting the artificial nerve network technique, this artificial intelligent system has been used for selecting wells and target formations to be fractured in sand reservoirs of complex faulty blocks fracturing in Zhongyuan oilfield. It can estimate daily increment per meter oil bearing layer, predict post-fracturing effect, provides scientific basis for selecting wells and formations to be fractured. The use of this system can decrease the risks resulted from the traditional selection by experiences over many years and increase the fracturing efficiency.

AB  - The general situation of using the AI (artificial intelligence) technology in coal preparation was introduced. The exert systems of coal preparation plant design, the exert management system of coal preparation plant, and the intelligent data-drawing bank were discussed. Some view points about their foundation and method of knowledge expressing, inference, knowledge discovery of databases were presented. It is pointed out that an industrial system such as a coal preparation, is big and complex, so it is necessary and also difficult to use the AI technology in these systems. Because the types of knowledge are different, the knowledge expression and the model of knowledge inference are various, the comprehensive methods suitable for the characters of the system must be used.

AB  - A review of plant growth modeling, simulation and visualization is presented. We categorize the plant models according to their specific purpose in applications. The classification will be helpful to recognize associated limitations of each model. It is pointed out that the 3-D visualization model provides a unique approach for the study of plant growth with respect to its morphological or geometrical information. Various methodologies are discussed for comparison when they are used in construction of morphogenetic and ecophysiologic models. These include fractal, L-systems, stochastic process, artificial intelligent, etc. The state of the art in 3-D visualization technique of plants is described. The current status of software development is given for applications in both agronomy/forestry and entertainment. Finally, we summarize the existing issues and highlight the perspectives from the viewpoints of research and applications.

AB  - Evidence reasoning has good performance in dealing with uncertain information and is used in many fields. It is necessary to analyze its robustness. We first give the definition of robustness based on the aim of evidential theory and define a new concept conflict rate. Using the sectional conflict rate, we analyze the robust area of Dempster rule, weigh distribution and absorptive method. Finally, computer simulation indicates that two new rules are more robust than Dempster rule. Moreover, we give a robust area of Dempster rule according to general identification frame.

AB  - Theoretical results and practical experience indicate that feedforward networks can approximate a wide class of functional relationships very well. This property is exploited in modeling chemical processes. Given finite and noisy training data, it is important to encode the prior knowledge in neural networks to improve the fit precision and the prediction ability of the model. In this paper, as to the three-layer feedforward networks and the monotonic constraint, the unconstrained method, Joerding's penalty function method, the interpolation method, and the constrained optimization method are analyzed first. Then two novel methods, the exponential weight method and the adaptive method, are proposed. These methods are applied in simulating the true boiling point curve of a crude oil with the condition of increasing monotonicity. The simulation experimental results show that the network models trained by the novel methods are good at approximating the actual process. Finally, all these methods are discussed and compared with each other. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A quality assurance expert system, ZJSYS, was developed for car cylinder casting by artificial intelligence technology and C++ for windows. The important feature of expert system is that it draws not only qualitative conclusions but also quantitative ones in the therapy of defects. ZJSYS adopts an reasoning strategy based on the rule models with the certainty factor. Reasoning strategy combines forward chaining and backward chaining together to perform qualitative analysis of defects. Meanwhile quantitative analysis of defects is completed by mathematical statistics and the principle of optimum. Management system that possesses the functions of adding, modifying and deleting was developed. To meet the practical requirements, the management model of data storage and statistics were developed. Actual run of ZJSYS shows that it plays a significant role in improving product quality and reduce rejection ratio.

AB  - The adaptive resonance theory (ART) is a representative, non-supervising neural network which can self-organically recognize complicated inputting patterns. Through analysis of ART algorithm it is found that the problem of the same phasic data with different amplitudes cannot be resolved by the ART-2/2A. There-by the new nonlinear transfer function and the competitive learning algorithm are introduced to expand the inputting field of the ART-2 algorithm from nonnegative number field to real number field. Then a relevant linear transformation method is presented to translate the problem. The problem of same phasic data with different amplitudes cannot be transferred by the ART-2/2A into the phasic division problem of the whole coordinate planes. These methods resolve the above-mentioned problem. The validation results show that the new ART-2A algorithm can deal with more far-ranging data and recognize unknown patterns adaptively and precisely.

AB  - Artificial neural networks are forms of artificial intelligence that learn correlative patterns between input and output information without a specific model. Then they use the learned relationships to make predictions. Five back - propagation artificial neural networks were constructed to recognize certain relationships in hydrogen attack to predict the time to incubate fissuring of 0.5Mo and carbon steel. Given the two parameters, environmental temperature and hydrogen pressure, these neural network models can offer a prediction with certain accuracy. The feasibility of the model was verified by the data from papers. It is proved that the ANN technology is applicable to the evaluation of the complicated system of hydrogen attack, and also gives a base to develop the expert system and residual life evaluation system for hydrogen attack.

AB  - A scheme based on neural network is presented to improve the fault detection and isolation (FDI) performance of a redundant strapdown inertial measurement unit. The neural network is trained to eliminate the effects of input axis misalignment, scale factor error and biases on parity vector. One advantage of the proposed technique over other compensation algorithm is that it does not require dynamic equation of error states and statistics of noise. When the neural network is trained on line with delayed samples, the compensated decision function is sensitive to slow-varying type fault. The simulation results show that the technique could significantly improve the FDI performance of the skewed inertial sensor sets.

AB  - An experimental micromanipulator system was established based on a novel serial-parallel micro-motion mechanism used for micromanipulation. Considering the characteristic of the mechanism, by combining the micro vision system of computer with a capacitive micrometer, a convenient and effective kinematics calibration method for plane micro motion mechanism was proposed. In addition, an alterable integral PI control method was adopted to keep precise control of the PZT. The validity of this serial-parallel micromanipulator system was verified by the experiment of drawing circles and rectangles.

AB  - With an advantage that the motion equation of the system can be linearized directly in closed form, a simple superelastic model for SMA (Shape Memory Alloy) was proposed in the equivalent linearization method. The method was employed to predict response of SMA superelastic system under stationary white noise excitation. The results are in good agreement with those obtained by numerical simulation in all excitation levels for systems with different damping capacities. It was finally concluded that the equivalent linearization method based on the model can be used in engineering with higher computation efficiency.

AB  - The novel concept of Compound-Agent is proposed, which consists of some independent sub-agents that share common beliefs and employ community actions. The Explicit Model of Coordination, which is used in the coordination of the sub-agents of compound-Agent, is provided. The actions of each sub-agent are rule-based determined, and the rule base can be adjusted on time. The approximate fuzzy reasoning is used to improve the speed of learn and reduce the number of rules, which makes Compound-Agent suitable for real time and dynamic applications. A real application, the design of the control system of flat-knitting machine employing the concept of Compound-Agent, is discussed briefly.

AB  - The proposed registration algorithm based on wavelet transform is a multi-resolution block matching one, which exploits the hierarchical self-similarity of Digital Subtraction Angiography images. This method befittingly trades off between the estimation precision and computational complexity, because the registration precision is from coarse to fine, which reduces the searching complexity of motion vector. This technique has been proved that the convergence speed is exponential. The proposed method takes full advantage of the precise location both temporally and frequently which characterizes the wavelet transform. Both the matching speed and consistency are boosted without the loss of matching performance.

AB  - Previous research shows that Wang-Smith chaotic simulated annealing, which employs a gradually decreasing time-step, has only a scaling effect to computational energy of the Hopfield model without changing its shape. This makes the net has sensitive dependence on the value of damping factor. Considering Chen-Aihara chaotic simulated annealing with decaying self-coupling has a shape effect to computational energy of the Hopfield model, a novel approach to improve Wang-Smith chaotic simulated annealing, which reaps the benefits of Wang-Smith model and Chen-Aihara model, is proposed in this paper. With the aid of this method the improved model can affect on computational energy of the Hopfield model from scaling and shape. By adjusting the time-step, the improved neural network can also pass from a chaotic to a non-chaotic state. From numerical simulation experiments, we know that the improved model can escape from local minima more efficiently than original Wang-Smith model.

AB  - This paper has reviewed the development of artificial intelligence in medical practice and medical diagnostic expert systems, and has summarized the application of artificial neural network. It explains that a source of difficulty in medical diagnostic system is the co-existence of multiple diseases--the potentially inter-related diseases. However, the difficulty of image expert systems is inherent in high-level vision. And it increases the complexity of expert system in medical image. At last, the prospect for the development of artificial intelligence in medical image expert systems is made.

AB  - The field of neural networks is still developing rapidly in automata control, artificial intelligence, pattern evaluation and so on. The hysteresis current control method is widely used in power factor correction and reactive power compensation. This paper introduces a three-phase converter controlled with a back propagation neural network as a current inner controller. The controller has a high performance in response of current and robustness and insensitivity to the parameter changes. The converter can work well when one phase current feedback signal losing or input supply unbalanced. A hysteresis band changed in terms with load condition. And space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) technique is used to decrease the switch losses and EMI.

AB  - It is well-known that traditional rule-based parsers have poor error recovery capability. This has limited their practicality in natural language processing, where robustness and flexibility are of primary concern. In view of this, we propose the neural network LR parser (NNLR) in which the shift-reduce parsing decision of the LR parser is simulated by a feedforward neural network. Being trained with a small set of grammatical sentences only, the NNLR is capable of parsing a significantly large number of erroneous sentences. To explore the knowledge encoded in the neural network that sustains its robust processing capacity, we analyze the NNLR in two ways. First, we show that in the NNLR, erroneous sentences are recovered as if the parser had filled in some of the empty slots in the original LR parsing table. An augmented parsing table is thus constructed. Second, a set of new grammar rules, commonly called error productions, can be extracted from the trained network. When being included in the original grammar, these rules allow certain erroneous sentences to be generated and parsed in addition to grammatical ones. In both analyses, the symbolic knowledge discovered is readily comprehensible, and it can potentially be re-used by the original LR parser to enhance its robustness. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Artificial neural networks (ANN) were applied to develop an in situ toughened Si3N4 expert design system in this paper. Mainly depending on experiments and tests, traditional research in materials science is costly and time-consuming. ANN belongs to a new kind of artificial intelligence technique, which can surmount difficulties in data analysis and model development, so it is suitable for non-linear and unstructured information processing in materials research. Four ANN models were developed to reciprocally predict the microstructure, sintering processing and mechanical properties of this material. Software with user-friendly graphical interface was developed with MATLAB language, which can help to easily and quickly realize the applications mentioned above. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The planning and scheduling in real shop floor is actually achieved by coordination between different persons. In this process, cooperation is mainstream, but competition also exists, for example, the competition between different groups, operators with the same skill, etc. In multi-agent based shop floor management and control system, this competition and cooperation relation must be embodied. The general process of shop floor production planning and scheduling is studied, and a colored Petri-net model for the competition and cooperation process of three main agents in such system to achieve shop floor production planning and scheduling is presented. The evaluating method of bids in bidding process that especially embodies the competition relationship is also presented. This colored Petri-net model gives a clear illustration of this complex coordination process to system designers, effectively promotes the cooperative development.

AB  - As an emerging branch of AI, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) has the inborn ability of quantitative interpretation and prediction simply based on similarity of historical events even there is difficulty to get the working mechanism, principles, or build statistical models for those complex systems. Since it is a perfect model of human recognition and its working mechanism is very similar to the human primitive reasoning logic, the introduction of CBR to geographical system (Geo-case based Reasoning) study to solve the problem of quantitative prediction was promoted. With tracking the front of international CBR research, expression and reasoning models of CBR have been promoted. And application of CBR model and method to specific geographical phenomenon has been fully discussed as well. The content of this paper can be summarized in the following aspects: (1) GeoCBR has been posed from the view of geographic case study. Furthermore, principle difference between GeoCBR and general CBR has been explored. (2) A comprehensive expression model for geographic case based reasoning has been established based on Tesseral model. (3) Geo-case based reasoning model was built in case of having fuzzy spatial-temporal distribution, a special FMP was used to calculate similarity of Geo-cases, and then reasoning model was given based on it. (4) With such a theoretical framework of Geo-CBR, a fishing ground prediction model, which can be regarded as a sample of Geo-CBR, has been built. This model has been applied to the East China Sea fishing center prediction. The validation result is satisfying.

AB  - A closed-loop algorithm to detect human face using color information and reinforcement learning is presented in this paper. By using a skin-color selector, the regions with color like that of human skin are selected as candidates for human face. In the next stage, the candidates are matched with a face model and given an evaluation of the match degree by the matching module. And if the evaluation of the match result is too low, a reinforcement learning stage will start to search the best parameters of the skin-color selector. It has been tested using many photos of various ethnic groups under various lighting conditions, such as different light source, high light and shadow. And the experiment result proved that this algorithm is robust to the varying lighting conditions and personal conditions.

AB  - Atom-type AI topological indices derived from the topological distance sums and vertex degree further are used to describe different structural environment of each atom-type in a molecule. The multiple linear regression based on combined use of the proposed Xu index and AI indices is performed to develop high quality QSPR models for describing six physical properties (the normal boiling points, heats of vaporization, molar volumes, molar refractions, van der Waals' constants, and Pitzer's acentric factors) of alkanes with up to nine carbon atoms. For each of six properties, the correlation coefficient r of the final models is larger than 0.995 and particularly the decrease in the standard error (s) is within the range of 45-86% as compared with the simple linear models with Xu index alone. The agreement between calculated and experimental data is quite good. The results indicate the potential of these indices for application to a wide range of physical properties. The role of each of the molecular size and individual groups in the molecules are illustrated by analyzing the relative or fraction contributions of individual indices. The results indicate that the six physical properties of alkanes are dominated by molecular size while AI indices have smaller influence dependent on the studied properties. Moreover, the studies demonstrate that each atomic group contributes an indefinite value to properties dependent on its structural environment in a molecule or other groups present. The cross-validation using the more general leave-n-out method demonstrates the final models to be highly statistically reliable. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A data fusion method for circuit fault diagnosis based on D-S evidential theory and fuzzy logical theory is presented. By measuring the temperature and voltage of circuit component, the belief function assignment of two sensors to circuit component is gotten, and the fused belief function assignment is gotten by using D-S rule, and fault component is found. By comparing the diagnosis results based on separate original data and fused data respectively, it is shown that the latter is more accurate than the former in the circuit fault recognition.

AB  - Conflict caused by multi-agents involved in a design is one of the key problems in cooperative design, but traditional researches often focus on domanial conflict detection and resolution. This paper studies the systematic resolution mechanism of conflict occurrence, prevention, detection and resolution from the view of design flow and system architecture. Based on this, a three level model of conflict resolution and the corresponding strategies of each level are proposed in detail. Conflicts are controlled effectively both in control level and domanial level. The model and methods were implemented and verified in a motorcycle cooperative conceptual design system (MCCDS), which establishes a steady ground for intelligent design and cooperative design.

AB  - The satisfiability (SAT) problem is core topic of the fields of artificial intelligence and computer science. Traditional algorithms treat the SAT problem as a constrained decision problem. The SAT problem is transformed into a global optimization problem to the objective function by a simple transformation, thus many algorithms can be used to solve it. Then the personification strategies obtained by observing and learning from the social and nature phenomena are presented. These strategies are generally straightforward and intuitive, and are helpful for the search process jumping out of local minimum, thus allow simulated annealing process to converge fast. These strategies explained how to select variables to flip in each iterative step and how to raise the system temperature when the search process got stuck the local minimum. Based on combining the simulated annealing algorithm and proposed personification strategies, a personification annealing (PA) algorithm for solving the SAT problem is presented. The PA algorithm inherits the global convergence property from simulated annealing algorithm and has the property of parallelism and inheritance. In order to compare the PA algorithm with local search algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm and WALKSAT algorithm, a C implementation of these algorithms was tested on random generated 3-SAT problem instances. The actual computational results show that the PA algorithm outperforms completely local search algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm and WALKSAT algorithm which is very popular recently, therefore the PA algorithm is feasible and efficient.

AB  - This paper, as the second of companion papers, discusses the property level and the dynamics level of the algebraic modeling for distributed problem solving in multi-agent systems. An algebraic formalization of macro-intelligent properties defined over agent colonies with different granularity is presented, which tries to explore the essential features of social intelligence and to describe the relation between macroscopic social intelligence and microscopic social interactions among agent individuals. The social dynamics associated with social intelligence is also addressed. As a result, a new hyper-distributed hyper-parallel algorithm for problem solving in multi-agent systems is obtained. The simulation on distributed self-organizing multi-task allocations and resource assignments, and the comparisons with other conventional methods show many advantages of the proposed algebraic approach.

AB  - Basically, there are two categories in distributed artificial intelligence (DAI): distributed problem solving (DPS) and multi-agent system (MAS). These companion papers are devoted to a new algebraic modeling approach to hyper-distributed hyper-parallel problem-solving in MAS, which is entirely different from the DSP and from other methods currently used in MAS. Authors try to capture the essential characters of social intelligence associated with complicated concurrent social interactions among individual agents in MAS. The algebraic approach universally deals with social interactions by means of social intelligence and social dynamics, and can be effectively used for such problem solving in MAS that might be difficult to solve in the context of social behaviors by using other conventional methods. This is the first of the companion papers, which addresses the typical social behaviors, their essential characters and their formalization. A conceptual architecture of the algebraic modeling approach to MAS problem solving is given. The social situation and social dynamics of algebraic modeling are also discussed. The simulation on distributed self-organized multi-task allocations and resource assignments shows the advantages of the algebraic approach in the context of social interactions.

AB  - An incremental time-delay neural network based on synapse growth, which is suitable for dynamic control and learning of autonomous robots, is proposed to improve the learning and retrieving performance of dynamical recurrent associative memory architecture. The model allows steady and continuous establishment of associative memory for spatio-temporal regularities and time series in discrete sequence of inputs. The inserted hidden units can be taken as the long-term memories that expand the capacity of network and sometimes may fade away under certain condition. Preliminary experiment has shown that this incremental network may be a promising approach to endow autonomous robots with the ability of adapting to new data without destroying the learned patterns. The system also benefits from its potential chaos character for emergence.

AB  - The cooperation of multi-robot is based on the multi-agent system (MAS) theory of distributed artificial intelligence that has become a hotspot in the robotics R and D. The multi-robot is regarded as multi-agent. So the communication and cooperation of multi-agent become the key problem for gaining the dynamic running information of cooperating robots. The authors introduce the communication modes for agent and provide a common strategy which aims at the communication resources of multi-agent model - the CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) protocol which is based on the transmittal medium. It supports the cable-communication of multi-robot and the experiments prove its validity.

AB  - The artificial intelligence is applied to the simulation of the automotive air-conditioning system (AACS). According to the system's characteristics a model of AACS, based on neural network, is developed. Different control methods of AACS are discussed through simulation based on this model. The result shows that the neural-fuzzy control is the best one compared with the on-off control and conventional fuzzy control method. It can make the compartment's temperature descend rapidly to the designed temperature and the fluctuation is small.

AB  - An algorithm for short term load forecasting based on a fuzzy model of the orthogonal least square method (OLS) is presented. The generation of fuzzy rules, and the selection of the model inputs and membership functions are all obtained from historical data. Therefore, the bottle-neck difficulty in knowledge acquaintance by questionnaire and experience is overcome. In the mathematic model, identification of the premise part and consequent part is separately accomplished. In the practical examples, the accuracy of this method is higher than that of the RBF method by 0.3%-0.5%. With this method, the computing time is only one second for every model.

AB  - Developing on opponent model, recognizing intentions and plans are necessary for effective communication in MAS. BDI is an effective way to describe mental state, which can be used to develop a generic opponent mental state model. As current research on the opponent mode focus on implications from unilateral action, they neither express simultaneous intentions and other relations, nor provide support to making decisions at real time. A generic opponent agent model based on BDI developed in this paper improves the research done by Anand S. Rao and Milind Tambe.

AB  - A new plan formalism method and a plan knowledge graph concept are presented. Compared with Kautz's formalism used widely in plan recognition, this method is simpler and more direct. Because a concept of supporting degree is introduced into plan knowledge graph, the recognized plans are changed reasonably as new evidences collected. A plan recognition algorithm based on knowledge graph presented in this paper can change the plan recognition problem into the graph searching one. This method not only prompts efficiency but also gives the same result as Kautz's.

AB  - BDI (belief, desire, intention) is a theoretical model based on agent computing, while its semantic is the key to the development of agent computing. The new BDI semantic is presented to have an evolution character by dividing B into subjective belief and objective belief, and by regarding possible world as a temporal stage of recognition procedure, which can describe agent and avoid the logical omniscience problem.

AB  - It is the traditional way to analyze spectra by experiences in astronomical field. And until now there has never been a suitable theoretical frame to describe spectra, which is may be owing to small spectra datasets that astronomers can get by low-level instruments. With the high-speed development of telescopes, especially on behalf of LAMOST, a large telescope which can collect more than 20 000 spectra in an observing night, spectra datasets are becoming larger and larger very fast. Facing these voluminous datasets, the traditional spectra-processing way simply depending on experiences becomes unfit. In this paper, we develop a brand-new language - describing language of spectra (DLS) to describe spectra of celestial bodies by defining BE (Basic element). And based on DLS, we introduce the method of RSDA (Rough set and data analysis), which is a technique of data mining. By RSDA we extract some rules of stellar spectra, and this experiment can be regarded as an application of DLS.

AB  - IKE (Internet key exchange, RFC2409) describes a suite of Internet key exchange protocols for establishing security associations and obtaining authenticated keying material. A security flaw in these IKE protocols is observed and a simple modification is proposed. It is pointed out that there is a neglected security flaw in the amended IKE protocols. And a successful attack on the amended IKE protocols is also provided. A new amendment to IKE protocols is proposed, and the reasons which cause the two security flaws are analyzed by using BAN logic successfully.

AB  - A novel neural networks control approach for manipulator with flexible end link was proposed. The manipulator with flexible end link was regarded as two parts: the flexible latter part that includes the last joint and the last link, and the rigid former part that is composed of the rest elements. In the proposed approach, a conventional model-based controller was used to control the rigid former part, a neural network was used to approximate the dynamic anti-model of the flexible latter part. Combined both together, the proposed approach achieved fine control effect in the emulation of a three links planar manipulator with a flexible last link.

AB  - To establish a formal inferential system of intention consequences is an important issue in the formal study of intention. A new formal system of intention consequences Lm5c based on reduced implication is proposed which provides a norm of intention consequences. Compared with other known formal systems of intention consequences, this system is simpler and possesses many desired properties, such as free from all cases of the known side-effects. Besides, it is powerful in reasoning about intention so that the agent itself can use it to perform tasks such as intention inference and goal revising.

AB  - Time-lag problem means that the system states are affected by both current states and past states. The qualitative simulation of the fixed time-lag problem is discussed. Discretization of the problem is analyzed, which makes it possible for us to consider the problem on discrete time points. Based on the Q2 algorithm, past constraints are added to represent the latency. By propagating quantitative information in the system with past constraints and current constraints, qualitative simulation of fixed time-lag system can be realized.

AB  - Based on the principle of human emulating intelligent control, an emulating human intelligent PID strategy for hydro-turbine governing systems is proposed. Using proposed algorithm and rules, a new intelligent controller is implemented easily, which has good real parameters adaptability and fast response and strong robustness because control parameters adjustment and control strategy change is based on measuring control error. The simulation studies and field tests indicate that the human emulating intelligent control can improve the dynamic performance and stability of the hydro-turbine governing systems.

AB  - Challenges and pressures from the growing globalisation of markets have made automotive enterprises shorten the product development cycle time and reduce costs through the increasing use of mathematics-based tools and processes. In order to bridge the gap between experience-based design and science-based engineering, this paper establishes a knowledge-based process planning system to fully support auto panel die development and design automation. The framework of this novel system is proposed, and key issues, such as knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation and knowledge-based design are described in detail. The function model of the system is proposed to illustrate the architecture and functionality of the system. The system provides users with just-in-time access to the appropriate knowledge and information to reduce the search burden. A practical example is used to show the great advantage of the knowledge-based process planning system.

AB  - C C Wang and coworkers built a belief combination model consisted of multiple exponential bidirectional associative memory(Multi-eBAM) through using eBAM with equal privileges and applied it into the voting decision making of multiple experts and obtained the latter decision-making performance. Using Chen improved eBAM (IeBAM) and endowing different privilege to each IeBAM or expert, a multiple weighted belief combination model consisted of IeBAM (Multi-WIeBAM) is constructed and investigated and becomes an extension to Wang Multi-eBAM model. Then its stability in synchronous and asynchronous updating modes in respectively proven and its corresponding decision-making performance and majority factor for different privilege of each expert are obtained. So the proposed model confirms the real-life voting decision. The initial analysis indicates that the majority factor of Multi-WIeBAM is tighter than that of the corresponding Multi-WeBAM, in other words, the former has better decision-making performance than the latter. Finally the experimental results also verify the above points.

AB  - Building whole concept lattice from database is a computing intensive operation in most cases. Sometimes people need only to find certain node in concept lattices. A novel approach to compute lattice node from database without generating the whole concept lattice is presented. Given a set of objects or attributes, by exploiting unique properties of concept lattice, it is are able to find the matching node, its parent nodes and children nodes in concept lattice directly. This avoids computing and memory burden brought by lattice generation, and it is useful in concept lattice application in large data sets.

AB  - The computational complexity of propositional clause set counterfactuals is discussed. It is proved that the computational complexity of propositional clause set counterfactuals is at the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, and computational complexity of propositional horn clause set counterfactuals is at the first level of the polynomial hierarchy. Furthermore. Some polynomial algorithms are presented for some subclasses of propositional clause set, such as the unique satisfiable clause set and the clause set of which only one subset is minimally inconsistent with the input clause whose inconsistency check can be solved in polynomial time.

AB  - A neuro-fuzzy system to model a delayed coking process was discussed. Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of delayed coking process, traditional optimization techniques lag behind the methods applied to the hydrocracking processing. The self-organizing neuro-fuzzy system process is simple structure, better generalization ability and can be applied to quality prediction for residue delayed coking plants.

AB  - In this paper, a genetic neural fuzzy system (GNFS) is presented and a hybrid learning algorithm divided into two stages is proposed to train GNFS. During first learning stage, Genetic algorithm is used to optimize the structure of GNFS and the membership function of each fuzzy term because of its capability of parallel and global search. On the basis of optimized training stage, the back-propagation algorithm (B-P algorithm) is chosen to update the parameters of GNFS to improve the system precision. The proposed GNFS is used to predict the weight of modeled part in injection process. The process of constructing quality prediction model for injection process based on GNFS is introduced. The results predicted by the constructed model show it can perform very well. The comparison between the presented GNFS and the other model based on regression and the neural network is made. The comparison verifies the proposed GNFS has superior performance and good generalization capability and also can apply to other industrial process. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The intelligent prosthesis shows better bio-imitability and adaptability than the conventional prosthesis by automatically regulating its parameters according to environments and working requirements. The intelligence of the upper limb prosthesis is mainly embodied in the control ability of automatic adaptation to the object's shape and forces when grasping it. On the other hand, the intelligence of the lower limb prosthesis is mainly demonstrated on the controlling of moment of knee joint and the in time responsibility to the outside impacts.

AB  - A novel strategy of Voronoi knowledge-based complex assembly for robot was presented. The Voronoi is used to analyse the relation of the parts during the robot assembly, and its result is represented as a knowledge of robot. The robot dynamically obtains the precise location relation of the parts by the force sensing and force control during the assembly. On the basis of Voronoi knowledge, the robot start to assemble. The experimental researches were implemented in a PUMA robot. The good result was obtained.

AB  - Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are relatively new computational tools and their inherent ability to learn and recognize highly non-linear and complex relationships makes them ideally suited in solving a wide range of complex real-world problems. However, very few is known of the use of this technique in ceramics although it is often invoked in diverse areas in chemistry. Here application of ANN technique to model the BaTiO3 based dielectric ceramic formulation was carried through. Based on the homogenous experimental design the experimental results of 21 samples were analyzed by a three-layer back propagation (BP) network. Through comparison we found that the ANN model is much more accurate than conventional multiple nonlinear regression analysis (MNLR) model for the same set of data. The results of ANN model were also expressed and analyzed by intuitive graphics. It indicates that the three-layer BP network based modeling is a very useful tool in dealing with problems with serious non-linearity encountered in the formulation design of dielectric ceramics. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a method of face detection based on self-organized hidden Markov model (Self-Organized HMM). Training the hidden Markov model using multi-view face samples respectively, the informative features and their connections are strengthened while the weak ones keep in low level. After the initial estimation of parameters and cliping out the weak connections in the states, the network can be self-organized into a multi-path left-right model (MPLR). Then EM algorithm is used to re-estimate the HMM parameters. During the detection, we can do the judgment by the optimal state sequence and maximum likelihood. It exploits the important structures of different views and facial features. Each path, corresponding to one discriminated view, keeps the structure of faces with super states from top to bottom, and also the left to right structure with states inside each of these super states. In order to handle the situation of face rotation in plane, face regularization is used to transform them into vertical samples. Dynamic color model, initialized with the built-in off-line trained model, is adaptive to the human races and lighting to reduce the computation of searching for the face candidates. During training, these multi-view paths are self-organized into one unified framework. In the framework, frontal vertical view has the longest states chain, while the side view has the shortest one and others are between them. In the states chains, they have some common states and connections, which in number depend on the panning angle among them. Comparing to the pseudo-HMM, the self-organized multi-path left-right hidden Markov model can detect the multi-view faces efficiently, not limited to the vertical-frontal views. Experiment results testify the efficiency of this algorithm: it can detect the frontal views at the rate of 95.3% and side views at the rate of 92.5% while keeping the false alarm rate at 5%.

AB  - Formal frameworks for the specification of rational agents are commonly based on logic of belief, desire and intention. In order to eliminate the problems with existing logic of belief, desire and intention, and to provide a proper semantic representation for non-normal modal operator, the problems with existing logic of belief, desire and intention are addressed, the true-false subset semantics, which is developed by the authors, and its application in the formalization of agent are introduced. The proposed framework invalidates the problematic properties of intention, and by imposing certain constraints on the algebraic structure of the models, it is showed that many desirable properties can be obtained. Finally the true-false subset semantics is analyzed. Thus the true-false subset semantics provides a proper semantic representation for non-normal modal operator. It is an important development of classical possible worlds semantics for normal modal operators, and is proved to be a powerful tool for the logical specification of rational agent behavior. It can be applied to establish a new proper agent logic system.

AB  - The agent organization is a kind of mechanism of problem solving, which can decrease the complexity of interactions between agents and reduce the difficulty of problem solving. A recursive model of agent organization is proposed based on role utility and organizational rules. The goal resolving, utility calculation and rule formation of agent organization are also discussed. Compared with the work of Ferber and Jennings, the recursive model is suitable to describe agent organizations with different scale, is useful for the combination of micro- and macro- analysis of agent organization and is able to express the agent organization evolution in some degree because of the introduction of role utility parameters.

AB  - The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification is a simple and effective classification approach. However, it suffers from over-sensitivity problem due to irrelevant and noisy features. There are two ways to relax such sensitivity. One is to assign each feature a weight, and the other way is to select a subset of relevant features. Existing researches showed that both approaches can improve generalization accuracy, but it is impossible to predict which one is better for a specific dataset. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to improve the effectiveness of k-NN by combining these two approaches. Specifically, we select all relevant features firstly, and then assign a weight to each relevant feature. Experiments have been conducted on 14 datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the results show that our algorithm achieves the highest accuracy or near to the highest accuracy on all test datasets. It increases generalization accuracy 8.68% on the average. It also achieves higher generalization accuracy compared with well-known machine learning algorithm IB1-4 and C4.5.

AB  - This paper presents an integration method to simulate transient stability based on artificial intelligence which integrates artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm. The method uses ANN instead of traditional differential equations to describe the input and output relationship of dynamic elements in power system. This paper also build a time delay artificial neural network in order to identify dynamic characteristics of pattern samples and uses Karhunen-Loeve transformation to reduce redundancy of input vector of ANN. In this paper, genetic algorithm is used to optimize the structure and train the weights of ANN for speeding up the simulation. The simulation result for IEEE 39 system illustrates the validity of the method.

AB  - Drawing inspiration from the vertebrate immune system, a new research field of Artificial Immune System (AIS) is springing up. As a novel branch of computational intelligence, AIS has strong capabilities of pattern recognition, learning and associative memory, hence it is natural to view AIS as a powerful information processing and problem-solving paradigm in both the scientific and engineering fields. This paper intends to give a comprehensive overview of AIS based on a preliminary theoretical framework, which is started with the brief interpretative introduction of biological models of vertebrate immune system, then followed with some extracted bionic principles, viz. immune recognition, immune learning, immune memory, clone selection, diversity generation and maintenance etc. The mapping from natural immune system to AIS models is emphasized in this paper. As a result, some typical AIS based models and algorithms are discussed through classifications.

AB  - This paper presents a method for modeling extended interval temporal logic (EITL) with Time Petri Nets (TPN). With TPN, the specifications of a system given by temporal statements can be transformed into a representation of graph, and the analysis techniques of TPN can be used for model solution. A new inference algorithm based on TPN and inequation rules is also proposed. With this algorithm, unknown temporal relations among the extended temporal intervals can be inferred from the known ones. Using this method, we can infer temporal relations qualitatively even if specific numerical value are not known. On the condition of knowing specific numerical value, inferring procedure can be simplified, and inferring result is unique. So it is more practical and more straightforward than the inference method which only uses inequation rules. Finally, the TPN model of extended interval temporal logic is extended to enhance its ability of modeling and analyzing parallel relations as well as conflict relations.

AB  - The main idea of SA'IVI used for classifying nonlinear separable data is to map the data into higher dimension linear space in which the data can be separated by a hyper plane. Based on Jordan Curve Theorem, a universal classification method based on hyper surface, which is called HSG classification, is put forward in this paper. The classification hyper surface is directly made to classify massive data according to whether the wind number is odd or even. It is a novel approach that does not need to make mapping from lower dimension space to higher dimension space and considering kernel function too. It can directly solve the nonlinear multiclasses classifying problem. The test reports show that HSC can efficiently and accurately classify large data.

AB  - In the model-based diagnosis, a key step is to compute the minimal hitting sets from the minimal conflict sets, because the minimal hitting sets of all the conflict sets are the faults of an investigated system. In Reiter's method, HS-tree is used for computing the minimal hitting sets. However, it will need a heavy work, and will result in the fact that the correct hitting sets are probably pruned away. A new method is put forward for computing minimal hitting sets by the binary hitting set tree, in brief, BHS-tree. This method will improve Reiter's approaches in the aspects as follows. (1) The number of BHS-tree nodes is apparently less than that of HS-tree; (2) As a result of being pruned, the loss of the minimal hitting sets will not produce; (3) When the new conflict sets are inserted, it is unnecessary to rebuild BHS-tree, instead, just adding the new branches to the BHS-tree. This property is extraordinarily useful for the actual diagnosis. Thus, the BHS-tree method is analyzed and verified in theory and the given programs are tested.

AB  - The importance of methodologies in handling the complexities of control systems has been demonstrated through some typical examples of solving complex problems in control theory. We point out that the methodology in control is a kind of structural high level intelligence, which should play an important role in intelligent control. The importance to discover such high level intelligence through the research on complex control systems is also pointed out.

AB  - An on-line structure-learning algorithm of belief network is proposed. The basic idea is to incrementally update the structure and parameters of a belief network after each group of data samples is received. The algorithm consists of two steps. The first step is to update the current belief network based on newly received data samples using incremental updating rules, including parameter incremental updating rule and three structure incremental updating rules, which are adding edge, deleting edge and reverting edge. The second step is to use the result selection criterion to select the most appropriate result from the set of candidates resulted by the first step. The selection criterion fulfills the desire to balance the consistency of the result with the newly received data against the distance between the result and the previous model. Experimental results show that the algorithm can efficiently perform on-line learning of belief network structure. Since on-line learning does not need history data and can adapt to the variation of the problem domain, this algorithm is suitable to model those domains that vary with time.

AB  - Objective: To make the manned space flight more efficient and safer, a concept of human-artificial (AI) system is proposed in the present paper. Method: The task of future manned space flight and the technique requirement with respect to the human-AI system development were analyzed. Result: The main points are as follows: 1)Astronaut and AI are complementary to each other functionally; 2) Both symbol AI and connectionist AI should be included in the human-AI system, but expert system and Soar-like system are used mainly inside the cabin, the COG-like robots are mainly assigned for EVA either in LEO flight or on the surface of Moon or Mars; 3) The human-AI system is hierarchical in nature with astronaut at the top level; 4) The complex interfaces between astronaut and AI are the key points for running the system reliably and efficiently. Conclusion: As the importance of human-AI system in future manned space flight and the complexity of related technology, it is suggested that the R/D should be planned as early as possible.

AB  - Selective disassembly is an important issue in industrial and mechanical engineering for environmentally conscious manufacturing. This paper presents an intelligent selective disassembly approach based on ant colony algorithms, which take inspiration from the behavior of real ant colonies and are used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. For diverse assemblies, the algorithm generates different amounts of ants cooperating to find disassembly sequences for selected components, minimizing the reorientation of assemblies and removal of components. A candidate list that is composed of feasible disassembly operations, which are derived from a disassembly matrix of products, guides sequence construction in the implicit solution space and ensures the geometric feasibility of sequences. Preliminary implementation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - In this paper, a new sufficient condition is given for the global asymptotic stability and global exponential output stability of a unique equilibrium points of delayed cellular neural networks (DCNNs) by using Lyapunov method. This condition imposes constraints on the feedback matrices and delayed feedback matrices of DCNNs and is independent of the delay. The obtained results extend and improve upon those in the earlier literature, and this condition is also less restrictive than those given in the earlier references. Two examples compared with the previous results in the literatures are presented and a simulation result is also given.

AB  - A concept of an intelligent optimal design approach is proposed, which is organized by a kind of compound knowledge model. The compound knowledge consists of modularized quantitative knowledge, inclusive experience knowledge and case-based sample knowledge. By using this compound knowledge model, the abundant quantity information of mathematical programming and the symbolic knowledge of artificial intelligence can be united together in this model. The intelligent optimal design model based on such a compound knowledge and the automatically generated decomposition principles based on it are also presented. Practically, it is applied to the production planning, process schedule and optimization of production process of a refining and chemical work and a great profit is achieved. Specially, the methods and principles are adaptable not only to continuous process industry, but also to discrete manufacturing one.

AB  - There have been numerous attempts recently to promote technology based education (Shrestha, 1997) in the poorer third world countries, but so far all these have not provided a sustainable solution as they are either centered and controlled from abroad and relying solely on foreign donors for their sustenance or they are not web-based, which make distribution problematic, and some are not affordable by most of the local population in these places. We discuss an application, the Local College Learning Management System (LoColms), which we are developing, that is both sustainable and economical to suit the situation in these countries. The application is a web-based system, and aims at improving the traditional form of education by empowering the local universities. Its economic ability comes from the fact that it is supported by traditional communication technology, the public switching telephone network system (PSTN), which eliminates the need for packet switched or dedicated private virtual networks (PVN) usually required in similar situations. At a later stage, we shall incorporate ontology and paging tools to improve resource share ability and storage optimization in the Proxy Caches (ProCa) and LoColms servers. The system is based on the client/server paradigm and its infrastructure consists of the PSTN, ProCa, with the learning centers accessing the universities by means of point-to-point protocol (PPP).

AB  - This paper presents an efficient way to preserve the volume of implicit surfaces generated by skeletons. Recursive subdivision is used to efficiently calculate the volume. The criterion for subdivision is obtained by using the property of density functions and treating different types of skeletons respectively to get accurate minimum and maximum distances from a cube to a skeleton. Compared with the criterion generated by other ways such as using traditional Interval Analysis, Affine Arithmetic, or Lipschitz condition, our approach is much better both in speed and accuracy.

AB  - Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis based on a combined use of the modified Xu index and the atom-type based AI indices is performed to construct quantitative structure-property models on several data sets of organic compounds including aliphatic aldehydes and/or ketones. For each of the physical properties (the normal boiling points, molar refractions, gas heat capacities at 25°C, water solubility at 25°C, and n-octanol/water partition coefficient at 25°C, high quality QSPR models are obtained, particularly the decrease in the standard error is within the range of 23.6-75.9% relative to the linear models with the modified Xu index alone. For individual subsets containing only aldehydes or ketones, in the majority of cases the quality of the model can be further improved. The significant improvement verifies the efficiency of the present approach and also indicates the usefulness of these indices for application to a wide range of physical properties. The results indicate that the physical properties studied are dominated by molecular size but atom types have smaller influences, especially the oxygen atom seems to be most important due to intermolecular polar interactions. The final models are validated to be statistically reliable using the leave-one-out cross-validation and/or an external test set.

AB  - In this paper, a functions localized network with branch gates (FLN-bg) is studied, which consists of a basic network and a branch gate network. The branch gate network is used to determine which intermediate nodes of the basic network should be connected to the output node with a gate coefficient ranging from 0 to 1. This determination will adjust the outputs of the intermediate nodes of the basic network depending on the values of the inputs of the network in order to realize a functions localized network. FLN-bg is applied to function approximation problems and a two-spiral problem. The simulation results show that FLN-bg exhibits better performance than conventional neural networks with comparable complexity. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A novel robot navigation algorithm with global path generation capability is presented. Local minimum is a most intractable but is an encountered frequently problem in potential field based robot navigation. Through appointing appropriately some virtual local targets on the journey, it can be solved effectively. The key concept employed in this algorithm are the rules that govern when and how to appoint these virtual local targets. When the robot finds itself in danger of local minimum, a virtual local target is appointed to replace the global goal temporarily according to the rules. After the virtual target is reached, the robot continues on journey by heading towards the global goal. The algorithm prevents the robot from running into local minima anymore. Simulation results showed that it is very effective in complex obstacle environments.

AB  - Neural oscillation is one of the most extensively investigated topics of artificial neural networks. Scientific approaches to the functionalities of both natural and artificial intelligences are strongly related to mechanisms underlying oscillatory activities. This paper concerns itself with the assumption of the existence of central pattern generators (CPGs), which are the plausible neural architectures with oscillatory capabilities, and presents a discrete and generalized approach to the functionality of locomotor CPGs of legged animals. Based on scheduling by multiple edge reversal (SMER), a primitive and deterministic distributed algorithm, it is shown how oscillatory building block (OBB) modules can be created and, hence, how OBB-based networks can be formulated as asymmetric Hopfield-like neural networks for the generation of complex coordinated rhythmic patterns observed among pairs of biological motor neurons working during different gait patterns. It is also shown that the resulting Hopfield-like network possesses the property of reproducing the whole spectrum of different gaits intrinsic to the target locomotor CPGs. Although the new approach is not restricted to the understanding of the neurolocomotor system of any particular animal, hexapodal and quadrupedal gait patterns are chosen as illustrations given the wide interest expressed by the ongoing research in the area.

AB  - As an important supplementary technique to the rule-based reasoning, the case-based reasoning (CBR) has been emphasized by researchers in the artificial intelligence field. In a case-based system, there are many kinds of knowledge, such as case base, adaptation knowledge base, indexing model, similarity assessing criteria, etc. There exists also a bottleneck in these knowledge acquisitions. The use of data mining may automatize the acquisition of the knowledge and heighten the whole competence of the intelligent system. This paper discusses emphatically data mining techniques which could be used in CBR, and puts forward two algorithms of case base acquisition from historical data base automatically. The experimental results show that this idea speeds up the implementation cycle of the CBR intelligent system and strengthens the operation efficiency of the system.

AB  - In terms of demands of rice farming in the southern China, the information processing system and the yield measurement system that is installed in combine harvester, are designed and completed. Now the systems have been used in demonstration site in the Experiment Base of Shanghai Precision Agriculture. Based on the idea of spatial-oriented, object-oriented, user-oriented, the Farm Geographic Information System for precision farming of rice was developed, which is characterized by intelligence and visualized. The Decision-making Management System is integrated with rice growth model, expert model for rice cultivation.

AB  - This paper discusses the development and application of a hybrid artificial neural network and genetic algorism methodology to modelling and optimisation of electro-discharge machining. The hybridisation approach is aimed not only at exploiting the strong capabilities of the two tools, but also at solving manufacturing problems that are not amenable for modelling using traditional methods. Based on an experimental data, the model was tested with satisfactory results. The developed methodology with the model is highly beneficial to manufacturing industries, such as aerospace, automobile and tool making industries. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis is used to construct the structure-boiling point models for 71 sulfur-containing organic compounds in terms of the Xu index and atomic level AI indices. The potential of these descriptors is further verified by three high quality QSPR models obtained for two subsets of compounds and a combined set of all compounds. For these subsets, containing respectively 45 sulfides and 26 thiols, the best three-parameter models are obtained, and the best four-variable model is obtained for the whole data set of 71 compounds. The correlation coefficients r are larger than 0.997 in all three final models. The standard errors s are 3.14, 2.48, and 3.48°C for the sulfide subset, the thiol subset, and the whole data set, respectively. Furthermore, the results indicate that the boiling points are dominated by the molecular size, but some atomic types in a molecule are important due to interactions between atomic groups of the molecules. Both the molecular size and atomic types related to different fundamental interactions provide the separate contributions to boiling points. Finally, the three final models are further validated to be statistically significant and reliable by the leave-one-out cross-validation method.

AB  - Network makes long the distance telerobotic surgery possible. Now the Internet is a more useful platform for telerobotic surgery, but it is now hard to satisfy the requirement of tele-surgery. The network time-delay is the main problem for the Internet-based telerobotic surgery. The development of network and its communication protocols is the key to the solution of this problem such as high durable communication lines and real-time protocol. The control strategy for network-based teleoperation in history can be used for reference. The event-based method and passivity and scattering theory are two promising methods for solving time-delay problems.

AB  - An example-based facial sketch system is presented, which automatically generates a sketch from an input image. All the example sketches are drawn with a particular style. There are two key elements in this system, a non-parametric sampling method and a flexible sketch model. Given an input image pixel and its neighborhood, the conditional distribution of a sketch point is computed by querying the examples and finding all similar neighborhoods. An expected sketch image is then drawn from the distribution to reflect the drawing style. Finally, good quality facial sketches are obtained.

AB  - In order to improve the remote fault diagnosis of substations and to enhance the diagnosis ability, a multi-agent diagnosis approach based on Web is put forward. With the aid of the widely distributed artificial intelligent systems connected by Web, the devices, supervisory control systems, diagnosis systems, researchers and users are closely related, though they are in individual zones. So the equipment status and diagnosis decision information are transferred quickly among them, and the dynamic diagnosis net is constructed. The function of each agent, their cooperation and multi-expert cooperation measure are discussed. A simulation indicates that the multi-agent fault diagnosis system possesses better adaptability, initiative and efficient interactive diagnosis performance.

AB  - This paper mainly discusses the selection of target structures for large scale complicated engineering structures such as high-rise buildings and long-span spatial structures. A case-based-reasoning system based on self-organizing-feature-map (SOFM) is put forward to solve this decision problem. The case library is built by object-oriented method, and the desired structural styles are searched or matched by SOFM. An example, in which a high-rise building is studied, illustrates the working process of the system.

AB  - The typical characteristic of the topology of Bayesian networks (BNs) is the interdependence among different nodes (variables), which makes it impossible to optimize one variable independently of others, and the learning of BNs structures by general genetic algorithms is liable to converge to local extremum. To resolve efficiently this problem, a self-organizing genetic algorithm (SGA) based method for constructing BNs from databases is presented. This method makes use of a self-organizing mechanism to develop a genetic algorithm that extended the crossover operator from one to two, providing mutual competition between them, even adjusting the numbers of parents in recombination (crossover/recomposition) schemES. With the K2 algorithm, this method also optimizes the genetic operators, and utilizes adequately the domain knowledge. As a result, with this method it is able to find a global optimum of the topology of BNs, avoiding premature convergence to local extremum. The experimental results proved to be and the convergence of the SGA was discussed.

AB  - A new strategy involved in training sample and algorithm for networks weights is put forward in this paper in order to fully seek information of original data and expedite convergence rate. A forgetting factor and an expecting factor varying with time are designed into training. On the other hand, an exponential energy function is introduced for forming a new algorithm to modify the weights of ANNs. Two case studies are presented. The results show that the suggested strategy is reasonable and functional.

AB  - An agent-oriented programming language with intention driver is proposed, which is called AOPLID. Based on open situation calculus, AOPLID can be regarded as improvement of GOLOG that is based on situation calculus. AOPLID can formalize some elements of the agents mental state, namely belief, intention, capability and strategy. A belief revision operator is introduced in AOPLID to deal with the communication and exogenous events. AOPLID solves the problems which GOLOG faces, such as inconvenience of describing the agent's mental state, lack of communication. The syntax of the AOPLID and its semantic under the OSC are presented. An example program of AOPLID that describes the coffee machine is given too.

AB  - Based on macro-time and micro-time, a BDI-Agent model with branch time tree is defined. In this model, parallel actions in macro-time are interleaving in micro-time. The mental state of Agent is constructed on macro-time, and the semantics of concurrent actions are given in micro-time level. Thus, it can be a proper logic basis for describing multi-Agent cooperation and competition that involve concurrent, and it can advance the work in Agent models developed by Rao and Georgeff, Singh and Werner et al.

AB  - This paper presents the application of Bayesian networks for the reliability assessment of power system. Bayesian networks can flexibly make expression and inference of uncertain information. Bayesian networks permit not only computing the reliability indices of a power system but also presenting the effect of each component or some components on the system reliability. A new method to construct Bayesian networks with the ideology of fault tree and minimal path sets are introduced in this paper. Thus the shortcomings of traditional reliability assessment methods are overcome. The results of two examples prove the validity and superiority of the method in the application of the reliability assessment of power system.

AB  - The development of DLR hand I and II in the last years is presented. DLR hand I is a multisensory 4-finger articulated hand, characterized by the fact that all 12 active joints (3 for each finger) are integrated into the fingers and the palm. With 112 sensors, around 1000 mechanical and around 1500 electrical components, the DLR hand I is one of the most complex robot hands ever built. Its key element is the artificial muscle, a small but powerful linear actuator, which seems to be one of the first real mechanical and electrical alternatives to hydraulic or pneumatic actuators. Based on the experimental results on the DLR h and I, the DLR hand II has been developed with four distinct advantages: 1. reconfigurable grasping palm by an extra motion between the thumb and the little finger; 2. an open skeleton structure for easy maintenance; 3. a new communication architecture which makes the cables connected to the cabling to the hand decreased from 400 in the hand I to only 12; and 4. a tine 6 degree of freedom force torque sensor is mounted on each fingertip for fine manipulation. Also the output force at fingertip is increased from 10 N to 30N. The new hand will play a key role in the service robots.

AB  - The sneak circuit analysis (SCA) is presented based on qualitative reasoning. The known qualitative electrical model is used, in which every edge of a graph has a non-negative electrical-resistance weight. A qualitative simulation algorithm is developed to obtain a qualitative description of the state of each electrical resistance. It is demonstrated that functional labels can be employed to simplify the results of the qualitative simulation and to provide functional information that is indispensable to SCA. Experimental results of a missile ignition system show that the method is effective.

AB  - A map layer integration model for automatic mapping of mineral resource potentials, called evidence theory model, was proposed. The model statistically integrated map layers via the evidence theory used in artificial intelligence, and the degree of one locality belonging to the ore-bearing sample set, measured by basic probability function, was used to express the mineral resource potential of the locality. This model could be applied to automatically generating mineral resource potential map in GISs. Drawing a mineral resource potential map with this model needed the following three-step procedure. First of all, every map layer was served as the evidence of a knowledge production rule, and whether a locality of the studied area belonged to the ore-bearing sample set or not was served as the corresponding hypothesis of the production rule, and the basic probability function related to the hypothesis was estimated. Secondly, the parallel rule used in the evidence theory was applied to combining all basic probability functions, so a combined basic probability function, which expressed the estimated degree of each locality belonging to the ore-bearing sample set according to the corresponding map layer group, was obtained. Thirdly, as the mineral resource potential map of the studied area, the combined basic probability function map was generated. According to the geological data of the district from Duolanasayi to Ashele in northen part of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the author applied evidence theory model and combined ore-forming belief model to mineral resource target selection. The mineral resource targets delineated by the two models corresponded to each other, which proved the evidence theory model being effective and practical.

AB  - This article presents a formal theory of on-the-fly cooperation. This is a new model of joint action, which allows for the possibility that a group of cooperating agents will, in general, have neither the information nor the time available to compute an entire joint plan before beginning to work. It proposes that cooperating agents need therefore only reason about what to do next; a plan only unfolds as cooperation continues. A detailed rationale is presented for the new model, and the components of the model are discussed at length. The article includes a summary of the logic used to formalize the new model, and some remarks on refinements and future research issues.

AB  - The quotient space model is extended to the fuzzy granular world and two main conclusions are given. First, the following four statements are equivalent: (1) a fuzzy equivalence relation given in universe X, (2) a normalized isosceles distance given in quotient space [X], (3) a hierarchical structure given in X, (4) a fuzzy knowledge base given in X. Second, the whole world with different fuzzy granularities composes a complete semi-order lattice. The results provide a powerful mathematical model and tool for granule computing.

AB  - How to make machines express emotions would be in establishing a completely new paradigm for man machine interaction. A new method for simulating and assessing artificial psychology has been developed for the research of the emotion robot. The human psychology activity is regarded as a Markov process. An emotion space and psychology model is constructed based on Markov process. The conception of emotion entropy is presented to assess the artificial emotion complexity. The simulating results play up to human psychology activity. This model can also be applied to consumer-friendly human-computer interfaces, and interactive video etc.

AB  - Originating in Allen's analysis of temporal relations, the notion of composition table has become a key technique in providing an efficient inference mechanism for a wide class of theories in the field artificial intelligence. This paper is mainly about the consistency-based composition table (RCC8 CT) of the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) raised by Randell, Cui and Cohn. First we show each RCC model is a consistent model of the RCC8 CT. Then after an exhaustive analysis we show that no RCC model can be interpreted extensionally anyway and hence give a negative answer to a conjecture raised by Bennett. All these results are given in an 'extensional' RCC8 composition table, where we attach to each cell entry in the RCC8 CT a superscript to indicate in what circumstances an extensional interpretation is possible. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The presentation method of mechanical kinematic scheme should support the whole process of conceptual design. To meet the requirement, a computer-aided conceptual design system must represent a scheme, generate a scheme, or scheme variants and evaluate the variants. Based on the demand of basic functions of scheme representation methods, a semantic network method is selected to represent process level, action level, mechanism level and the relationship among them. Computer-aided motion cycle chart exploration can be realized by representation and adjustment of the mechanism time coordination and its effect on the design scheme. The uncertain reasoning technology based on semantic network is applied to construct a semantic network fragment. The closeness degree formula is determined by matching and comparison between value to value, value to range, range to range of the design cases and design requirements. It is applied in the mechanism types selection of needle driving mechanism of industrial sewing mechanism, and the application indicates it is correct, useful and advanced.

AB  - This paper described some essential characteristics of the self-reconfigurable robots. A model of description on self-reconfigurable robots, and a self-organizing metamorphic strategy of self-reconfigurable robots based on discrete local intelligence were proposed. This strategy results in the self-organization of robot system through local communication between modules, and the complexity of metamorphic algorithm is reduced. An illustration of 9 modules system was given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategy.

AB  - An approach to the revision of a finite belief set is presented. First, a procedure for generating all the minimal inconsistent sets is introduced, and the correctness of the procedure is proved. Then what discussed further is that how to apply the procedure to the implementation of some representative methods, and an implemented prototype for belief revision is introduced. At last, the presented approach is compared with other related work.

AB  - The Artificial Immune System (ATS) inspired by the natural immune system is introduced. Based on exhaustive algorithm, a new algorithm is presented as detectors generating method in the negative selection model, including its design, performance analysis and experiment. Both mathematical analysis and experiment show that the algorithm runs in time linearly with the size of the detector set. The new algorithm can possibly generate a more powerful detector set than exhaustive algorithm.

AB  - Feed system is one of the most important functional structures in injection mold. Based on the features of design knowledge used in feed system, a hybrid knowledge model, characterized by its hybrid connectionist and symbolic nature, was introduced. The knowledge model is represented by frame-rule formulation. It not only can manage fuzzy or imprecise knowledge, but also can deal with both explicit and implicit knowledge effectively. An intelligent, prototype system for the design of feed system based on the hybrid knowledge model was developed. Finally, an illustrative example proves the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.

AB  - A method of fast vehicle-license-plate (VLP) location was proposed. Because of the high and mass energy in horizontal direction, the candidates of VPL can be fast and roughly segmented by an adaptive high-pass energy filter. Then, the candidates are validated and modified according to the fine texture feature of VLP. In this way, VLP can be accurately located. Experimental results show that with this method, the accuracy of VLP location is above 99% and each location needs only 50 to 60 ms.

AB  - The steps of conceptual design for mechanism system are: (1) the conception of technology movement process, the main constitutes of which are the improvement based on existing examples, synthesis based on every basic motion, and analysis of personification; (2) the decomposition of technology movement process. The gained independent movements are called executive motion; (3) choosing or innovating executive mechanisms to achieve each motion; (4) introducing morphological matrix, this method can help us forming some mechanism system; (5) by synthetical evaluation, the most excellent mechanism system can be found. This function resolution method is called the method of technology-movement-mechanism. This method made conceptual design for machines and design for mechanism system unified. This paper illuminated its application with an example.

AB  - Optical flow was computed based on the block relative algorithm, which is used for hand tracking. Velocity vector between two adjacent hand positions is extracted and quantified by eight-directional chain code as observation vector, which provides more robust recognition rate than position vector. CHMM (Coupled Hidden Markov Model) was used to recognize dynamic two-hand gestures. MAP (Maximum a posteriori) was proposed and realized for CHMM's training. Experiments on six dynamic two-hand gestures show that CHMM is more effective to model two-hand gesture than traditional HMM.

AB  - Production scheduling is one of the most important problems to be considered in the effective performance of the automatic manufacturing system. It is the typical kind of NP-complete problem. The methods commonly used are not suitable to solve complicated problems because the calculating time rises exponentially with the increase of the problem size. A algorithm-immune based scheduling algorithm (IBSA) is proposed. After the description of the mathematics model and the calculating procedure of immune based scheduling, some examples are tested in the software system called HM_IM and C that is developed using VC++6.0. The testing results show that IBSA has high efficiency to solve scheduling problem.

AB  - The existing pursuit researches focus only on the single evader situation, and is imposed some limitations such as the evader has either slower speed or smaller view-field than that of the pursuer; the evader can only evades randomly; the evader and the pursuer move by turns. For this problem, a new cooperative multiple mobile targets capture algorithm (CMMTCA) is proposed. In the CMMTCA, the evaders have the same speed and view-field as those of the pursuers, and both of them move intelligently and simultaneously. According to the different types of the evaders, firstly the pursuers execute the moving targets commitments generating algorithm (MTCGA) to form sub-group dynamically, and then the sub-groups pursuit the committed targets cooperatively following the CMMTCA. The simulation results show that the intelligent evaders can be captured effectively and efficiently, and the low complexity of CMMTCA justifies its real-time implementation on the robots under dynamic environment.

AB  - The intelligent design theory of structural form selection is applied in large span structures. A prototype system of intelligent choice of structural form for large span structures is developed. Microsoft Access 2000 for Windows is used as a foreground developing tool for building case base system, Microsoft Visual C + + 6.0 for Windows as a developing tool for scheme generation, and the Expert System Development tool C-ADVISOR 3.0 as a developing tool for scheme evaluation and decision-making. The system includes three sub-systems: case base system (CBS), scheme generation system (SGS), and scheme evaluation system (SES) and scheme decision-making system (SDS). CBS is built on the techniques of object-oriented programming, SGS on the Case Reasoning and data mining, and SES and SDS on fuzzy inference and fuzzy multiple-attribute decision-making.

AB  - Traditional rough analysis method can produce a set of reduced decision rules from a decision table by attribute reduction and value reduction. These rules can provide decision support to some extent. However, the process of attribute reduction and value reduction is at the cost of many decision support abilities, so that the obtained rules remain just some part of the whole decision support abilities of the original decision table. In many cases, the set of reduced rules is often unable to offer decision support, which could be offered by the original decision table. A family of rough analysis methods for decision support, called Rough Decision Support Method (RDSM), is proposed. RDSM can make the best use of the decision support abilities of decision table, and provide powerful decision support. RDSM is essentially an error-tolerable method. RDSM and the traditional method can be combined into a hybrid decision support model, which can offer powerful decision support at high speed.

AB  - As a formal tool for knowledge representation and reasoning, description logic provides the decidable reasoning service. This paper proposes a new description logic with default reasoning, which integrates monotonic reasoning and non-monotonic reasoning while avoiding the difficulty of Reiter's default logic. Based on the description logic with default reasoning, we construct a knowledge base system that incorporates Tbox, Abox and default rules. Then we discuss several reasoning problems including concept satisfiability, default satisfiability, concept subsumption, default subsumption, and instance checking. Furthermore, we present a new algorithm called Tableau-D that is used to check the satisfiability and default satisfiability. Finally a transformation theorem of default satisfiability and default subsumption is also attained.

AB  - Pattern identification of energy loss in operation is one of the fundamental matters for diagnosising economy of boiler operation. This paper aims at proposing an on-line identification method for operation pattern of boiler based on artificial intelligence theory. The paper studies the expression of operation pattern of boiler, the construction of eigenvector of operation pattern, the method of pattern identification and its application, etc, and proposes some basic concepts such as the generalized eigenvector of operation pattern and redundant characteristic parameter. Further more, the pattern identification model of boiler operation based on self-organizing map (SOM) networks is established. The result shows that (1) this pattern identification model can effectively recognize the main energy loss in boiler operation; (2) the impact of work condition variation on the effect of pattern identification can be avoided by constructing generalized eigenvector; (3) introducing of redundant characteristic parameter can obviously improve the ability of model to identify operation pattern. The validity of the method mentioned above is proved by the case studies of pattern identification of energy loss about contamination on heating surface and air leak of system in utility boiler.

AB  - A knowledge representation was proposed by the state-space theory of artificial intelligence for dynamic programming model (DPM) which can be defined as M=(I,G,O,T,D,S). A building block modeling method is used to form a rule-based solution model. A rule-based system was designed and set up to solve the DPM. This knowledge-based representation can be easily used to express symbolical knowledge and dynamic characteristics for DPM, and the inference based on the knowledge in the process of solving DPM can also be conveniently realized by computer.

AB  - A computer-assisted learning/teaching model is conceived with the implications of the constructivist theory and an analogy between the traditional art form Shuanghuang and the teaching/learning environment. The virtual character of the model interacts, in the form of human behavior and speech supported by recognition biometrics, text-to-speech and artificial intelligence, with the learner and simulates, to the full extent, the process and effects of the art form. Some issues of pedagogical dimensions, knowledge and the role of the human teacher related to the model are discussed.

AB  - A multi-observation fusion method based on the fuzzy theory is proposed to deal with the uncertainties and conflicts caused by redundancy observations in the spacecraft diagnostic system. The first step of this method is to fuzzify inputs, the second step is to fuse the outputs of the fuzzified inputs, and the last step is to evaluate the fusion results. This method shows how to address the conflicts problem. The example shows that the fusion method is practical.

AB  - The belief propagation algorithm for decoding low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes in the binary-input continuous-output memoryless AWGN channel is introduced. According to the behaviors of density evolution, the existing problems on quantization design for iterative decoding in different message spaces are discussed. For messages in the form of probability or probability difference, the only proper selection for the time-invariant quantized decoding is uniform quantization to achieve a satisfactory performance. In contrary, the log-likelihood ratio messages roughly have the Gaussian mixture densities during iterations, this makes it simple to perform symmetric quantization and hence to provide unbiased measures for coded bits 1 and -1 at the channel input. Furthermore, when using nonuniform quantization, some levels can be allocated across the larger message region, which may improve the convergence of belief propagation in case the algorithm is convergent. Simulations demonstrate that the nonuniform scheme outperform the uniform one.

Both the components and system description are represented as Boolean variables. And the Boolean algebra algorithm is presented to compute hitting sets. The efficiency of this algorithm is better than the other works, data structures are simpler, and the correct answers are not lost. This algorithm could be used more widely.

AB  - The present mode of network information exploitation has some serious drawbacks because that the massive, stochastic, distributed and parallel behaviors related to information exploitation in the networks are always considered to be of non-aftereffect and independence from each other. This paper presents a novel self-organizing mode of network information exploitation, and a generalized cellular automata (GCA) approach to the network information self-organization. By our methodology, every information exploitation behavior happened in networks is always associated with proliferating some information contents among the networks to a certain extent, so that some self-organized distributed patterns in terms of different information contents and different content granularities will be generated by a great number of random information proliferations in the networks. It is these information self-organizing patterns that our new mode for network information exploitation is based on. This paper is also addressed to the architecture, cellular dynamics and algorithm of a GCA which is used for discovering the above information self-organizing patterns caused by massive exploitation behaviors in the networks. The analysis and simulation show many advantages of our approach over presently used methods in respect to efficiency, robustness, suitability and reliability for network information exploitation.

AB  - A customer behavior analysis algorithm based on swarm intelligence is proposed. Firstly, customer consumption patterns are randomly projected on a plane. Then, clustering analysis is processed by a clustering method based on swarm intelligence with different swarm similarity coefficients. Finally, the clustering customer groups with various consume characteristics are collected from the plane by a recursive algorithm. A parallel strategy is also proposed. It improves the scalability of the algorithm. The data of telecom mobile customer consumption are used in the experiment. The results are compared with the results obtained by other clustering methods such as k-means algorithm and self-organizing maps algorithm. The comparison shows that this customer behavior analysis algorithm based on swarm intelligence meets the demands of customer clustering and classifying of customer relationship management. Especially, on the aspect of master customer analysis and one to one sell analysis, the algorithm shows the advantages of visualization, self-organization and clusters with distinct characteristics.

AB  - An optimization method based on uniform design in conjunction with genetic algorithm is described. According to the proposed method, the uniform design technique was applied to the design of starting experiments, which can reduce the number of experiments compared with traditional simultaneous methods, such as simplex. And genetic algorithm was used in optimization procedure, which can improve the rapidity of optimal procedure. The hierarchical chromatographic response function was modified to evaluate the separation equality of a chromatogram. An iterative procedure was adopted to search for the optimal condition to improve the accuracy of predicted retention and the quality of the chromatogram. The optimization procedure was tested in optimization of the chromatographic separation of 11 alkaloids in reversed-phase ion pair chromatography and satisfactory optimal result was obtained. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Multi-agent system design is a very challenging work, as communication and cooperation between agents are vital to the performance of the system. A much advanced agent role modeling based on Multi-agent system architecture devised by Peter Stone was proposed to avoid the instability factors and the loss of efficiency caused by the possibility of too frequent role switching. Adjusting techniques based on this potential role method were suggested to solve the problems associated with system design and implementation. Application of this potential role method to RoboCup simulation system was presented as an example.

AB  - Based on T-norm/S-norm, Fl and F2 fuzzy neuron models are proposed for the first time in the paper. Their properties and applications are discussed here. Fl model holds good sensitivity and poor robustness. However F2 model holds good robustness and poor sensitivity. The paper presents a necessary and sufficient condition of that a generalized AND/OR operator based on Fl model is a weak T-norm/S-norm cluster. The paper set forth the concept of weak bound triangular norm for the first time, further, finds out a particular F2 model which can realize weak bound triangular norm. Then the paper points out that Fl model is more suitable for industrial control systems and F2 model is more suitable for those computer application systems such as fuzzy expert system in the fields of medicine, law and strategic decision et al. Finally, a fuzzy neural network based on a particular F2 neuron is applied in fuzzy inference. The new inference method generalizes traditional Zadeh's CRT and satisfies modus ponens and other inference principles when the weights are adjusted in right way.

AB  - Manometry of the alimentary tract is a valuable and widely used means to evaluate and diagnose the function of the alimentary tract. However, the measurement can be inconvenient due to the invasive method used, and the many factors affecting results. Research on colonic pressure data is even more insufficient. This paper deals with colonic pressure data via an improved method ensuring that pressure data of the whole colon is available. The data is analysed based on the learning vector quantization (LVQ) method. Testing results show that this method distinguishes the normal data and the abnormal data, consistently with the original diagnoses. This method can serve as an assistant diagnosis of colonic motility and contributes to further research on colonic motility based on pressure data.

AB  - The relationship of Semantic Similarity of an Object as a Function of the Context (SSOFC) being the key factor in data integration is investigated. The SSOFC is a context-based system, which exploits the context of an object by utilizing the semantic similarity involved, in order to reconcile bottleneck conflicts (semantic) standing in the way of interoperability acquisition in heterogeneous systems. SSOFC is further re-enforced with the agents to equip architectural intelligence and facilitate the cooperative tasks, such as the versatility to pass, share, communicate, liaise, and negotiate the information among the architectural components in a human way. The SSOFC operates in semantic and schematic spaces that are linked with a projection facilitated by cooperative agents. In the Semantic Space, the semantic proximity (semPro) through its first component context captures the real world semantics from the local heterogeneous sources. Meanwhile, in Structural Space, the schema correspondences are paramount in order to capture structural similarities in an algebraic or mathematical formalism for reasoning and manipulation on the computer.

AB  - Nowadays, information is the most important factor for any manufacturing enterprise. Information helps a manufacturer to make decisions about management, production, operation, maintenance, and repair. Information technology is a key for enterprises who are realising integrated manufacturing all over the world. Data acquisition is the backbone of information technology. Data acquisition technology is the product of the fusion and interaction of many technologies. It is necessary to develop new data acquisition technology and methods by using the recently produced research results. It is also important for realising manufacturing automation, promoting product quality, and enhancing the competitive ability of an enterprise. In this paper, we first analyse three common kinds of data acquisition mode and their features used in manufacturing systems. Then, based on the background of manufacturing automation, agents and distributed artificial intelligent technology, which form a new data acquisition model framework suitable for an advanced manufacturing system, is proposed, and some details about this new model are discussed. Two examples of this model used in manufacturing systems are then given to show the availability and correctness of this model framework. We conclude with current research results in this area and give an outline of future work.

AB  - Ontology is defined as a formal explicit specification of conceptualization, the network management knowledge model based on ontology is explored. The framework of knowledge model is presented, which is divided into primitive model and integrated model. Primitive model includes information models, function models and network models. Integrated model is the result of integration of primitive models based on requirement of network management. The integration of knowledge model is based on ontology algebra and the process of knowledge model is based on ontology inference and query. A prototype of NMS is designed, which is based on the network management knowledge model. The main characters of the prototype are separation of knowledge process and information process, customization of supported operations and knowledge level integrated network management. The validity of knowledge model is illustrated by the prototype.

AB  - Most of artificial intelligent methods are based on theory of empirical risk minimization principle which may cause low aeroengine fault diagnosis rate even with large learning fault samples. In this paper, we presented a new aeroengine intelligent fault diagnosis system model using support vector machines (SVM) which was based on an novel theory - structural risk minimization (SRM) inductive principle. Due to the binary classifier of common Support Vector Machines, we first developed a multi-class support vector machines for faults pattern recognition as described in detail in section 2. We then constructed an diagnosis model via the multi-class SVM in section 3. Non-linear mapping relationship between faults patterns and faults performance can be induced by the model. Also the model can control learning generalization ability with SRM. In section 4, we used the model for turbofan engine gas fault diagnosis. The results show that the model is efficient for accurate and robust fault diagnosis, and only a few fault samples are necessary to be trained for new faults diagnosis.

AB  - Artificial immune clustering is used to determine the number and initial positions of the centers in radial basis function (RBF) network according to input data sets. By extracting the preliminary knowledge about the width of the basis function as a vaccine to form the immune operator, the searching space of the algorithm was reduced. The computer simulations demonstrate that the RBF network designed in this method has a concise structure with good generalization ability.

AB  - An intelligent static model for controlling end points without the use of a substance is implemented at WISCO's No 2 steelshop. Target hitting rates for C content are considered good with 80% within ±0.02%, built are inferior for temperature with 73% within ±20°C, due to variable delays between tapping and recharging the converters. Refining in the converter is governed by a complex interaction of chemical and physical reactions. Control models employing artificial intelligence networks (ANN) are used to achieve close control.

AB  - Objective: To determine the positions of marking in the presence of distracting shadows, highlight, pavement cracks, etc. Methods: RGB color space is transformed into I1 I2 I3 color space and I2 component was used to form a new image with less effect of the clutter. Using an improved edge detection operator, an edge strength map was produced, and binarilized by adaptive thresholds. The binary image was labeled and circularity of all connected components is calculated. The Self-Organizing Mapping is adopted to extract regions which imply potential marking. Finally the position of marking was obtained by curve fitting. Results: Color information was utilized fully, all thresholds were set adaptively and lane marking could be detected in challenging images with shadows, highlight or other cars. Conclusion: The method based on circularity of connected components shows its outstanding robustness to lane marking detection and has a wide variety of applications in the areas of vehicle autonomous navigation and driver assistance system.

AB  - Most previous qualitative spatial or spatio-temporal reasoning researches focused only on one single aspect and therefore were inadequate for realistic applications. A representation and reasoning technology for integrating topology, size and time information are proposed and applied to a spatio-temporal geographical information system. The representations of topology, size and time are defined and their interdependence is studied. Then an algorithm TriRSAT which can solve the CSP of these three aspects of information is put forward. The representations are used in the constraint base and the TriRSAT is applied to the consistence check of the spatial-temporal data and query. The methods and theories integrating spatio-temporal information effectively can be potentially applied to spatio-temporal database and robot navigation.

AB  - Bayesian network is becoming more remarkable in AI research fields, which plays important role in modern expert system, diagnoses system and decision system. Bayesian network works on three points as below: knowledge representation, learning and inference. Probabilistic methods are its mathematical fundamental which helps learning distribution from data and leads Bayesian theory to real application. This paper introduces various common methods in probability data learning and make comparison among them under various application background. The methods based on classical statistics have a matured theory and a set of simple and direct calculation. But they rely heavily on sample data, which apply only those information from sample data with expert knowledge left aside. Bayesian Network combines information of expert knowledge and sample data together. It can give more accurate learning result and rely less on sample data. Parameter learning is main part of learning Bayesian Network models, and it' s the basis of Bayesian Network learning.

AB  - The recycling process planning of waste products is discussed systematically and the recycling process model of waste products is established. As an important recycling mode of wasted products, the material recycling is emphatically analyzed. Firstly, the recycling object model in the material recycling is set up with the characteristic theory. Based on the model, the recycling process search is carried out with the Agent technique, to form the feasible process topological graph. With the graph theory and the recycling practices, the topological graph is analyzed and the feasible recycling processes are obtained. At last, the refrigerator box (including the door) is taken as an example to validate the method.

AB  - Evolutionary algorithms have obtained great attention regarding their potential for solving complex problems, such as optimization of objectives, artificial intelligence, machine learning and so on. Also in the family of EA there exist many different algorithms variants, they have the same mechanism in schemata evolution. This paper shows the schema theorem and the building blocks hypothesis can be used for explanations of the foundation in EA, Here, some new concepts are introducing, such as schema evolution, schema evolvability and appropriate schema. Authors prove that when mutation is independent, it may be performed either before or after multi-point crossover, the consequences of schema in EA are probabilistically the same. Authors derive the schema theorem based on the concept of schema evolvability proving that schemata of more power than others accept an exponentially increasing number of trials over time. Specially, authors use multi-point crossover to obtain schemata evolution equation instead of one-point crossover. Holland's schema theorem and the building block hypothesis attempt to explain the power of Genetic Algorithms (GA), Schema theorem presented has the same purpose, but it is different from Holland's schema theorem in expression and essential. Finally, an argumentation of building blocks hypothesis is regarded as building blocks theorem.

AB  - This paper approaches the problem about the heat storage setting and its release time during the energy synthesis for batch processes, points out that the economy analysis must be considered according to production scale. The paper also proposes the economy criterion to decide heat storage to be set or not. Moreover, the paper presents the optimization strategy for confirming the heat storage setting and its release time based on the method of artificial intelligence (AI). Compared with literatures, the above strategy can deal with not only the depreciation of energy quality, but also the effect of practical engineering factor of batch process, such as the distant match and its investment of pipeline and the flow exergy dissipation. This paper also proposes the steps of the heat exchanger networks synthesis for batch process. Further, the paper also proposes the conception of the period of investment reclamation, which can provide the economy criterion for investment decision-marker. A case study illustrates the method presented by this paper is practical. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - On the basis of time series analysis of diaphragm wall deformation in deep pit system, a MATLAB system-based ANN multi-step deformation forecast model is developed. The deformation corresponding to multi-steps of excavation can be predicted with this model at a time, and the construction parameters can be adjusted in time, so that the diaphragm wall deformation can be controlled. The deep foundation pit of north anchorage of Runyang Bridge is taken as a case example to make study on intelligent forecast and control of construction deformation, and it is showed that the results of prediction agree well with the data of in-situ measurement.

AB  - Based on fuzzy Petri net, human knowledge representation and reasoning under multi-constraints are discussed. And then, combining fuzzy Petri net with matrix operation, an algorithm of formalized fuzzy reasoning process is proposed, in which all of the constraints in the reasoning rules, such as weights of the input propositions, thresholds of the transitions, degree of truths of the rules, and multiple conclusions rules, are considered. It demonstrates that the fuzzy reasoning process is accomplished more simply, quickly and easily as the algorithm is adopted and the efficiency of the reasoning is also improved due to the parallel operation ability of Petri net.

AB  - To support the networked manufacturing mode, a system integration architecture and its implementing methods for advancing and promoting the traditional manufacturing resources in shop floor are presented. Firstly, the multi-agent system (MAS) technology derived from distributed artificial intelligence, and the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) technology, are used to model and encapsulate manufacturing resources in shop floor in an unified manner. Then, the modeled member agents on behalf of corresponding manufacturing resource entities are integrated into the proposed system architecture based on CORBA in plug-and-play manner. Based on the system integration architecture, the manufacturing resource integration and the manufacturing execution system are developed to support networked manufacturing for virtual manufacturing organization.

AB  - Binarization is the most popular discretization method in decision tree generation, while for the domain with many continuous attributes, it always gets a big incomprehensible tree which can't be described as knowledge. In order to get a more intelligible decision tree, this paper presents a new discretization algorithm, RCAT, for continuous attributes in the generation of binary classification tree. It uses simple binarization to solve the multisplitting problem through mapping a continuous attribute into another probability attribute based on statistic information. Two pruning methods are introduced to simplify the constructed tree. Empirical results of several domains show that, for the two-class problem with a preponderance of continuous attributes, RCAT algorithm can generate a much smaller decision tree efficiently with higher intelligibility than binarization while retaining predictive accuracy.

AB  - An intelligent design model of structural form selection based on case reasoning is put forward to simulate the way of thinking in images of experts. The essence of case retrieval lies in clustering and classification of patterns. Neural computing, pattern recognition and case-based reasoning (CBR) are integrated into a hybrid intelligent design system, to generate a CBR method based on neural pattern recognition. The effectiveness of this method is shown by its application in the design practice of structural form selection of high-rise buildings.

AB  - The computer-supported collaborative learning is one important mode of Internet learning. Group members communicate with each other with synchronous or asynchronous communication tools. Current researches on collaborative learning pay more attention to the communication tools than to the knowledge management function. A knowledge management method based on the ontology in collaborative learning is proposed. The experiment shows that the knowledge extraction, maintenance and sharing can be accomplished by this method.

AB  - Characters of resistance spot welding procedure case are divided into two kinds: characters I of case and characters II of case by analyzing resistance spot welding and the CBR (case based reasoning). The retrieving strategy is proposed, that is, under the limit of characters I thermal physical properties of material and thickness of plate in characters II of case are taken as indexes. The knowledge and rules of spot welding procedure that are drawn out from the retrieved cases database with fuzzy inference are used to guide the solution of new procedure case. It gives a good method to solve the problem that it is difficult to build an appropriate model to revise the similar retrieved cases on CBR. In this way, the intelligent solution to spot welding parameters resembles to the way of experts in this field and has more flexibilities.

AB  - Collaborative learning is a kind of group learning mode. It emphasizes the communication and collaboration among group members. Current collaborative learning systems haven't reached a high intelligent degree, and some problems such as dynamic grouping have not been solved. Dynamic grouping refers to the problem that how the members who are interested in the same subject can form a learning group dynamically. To solve this problem, this paper comes up with a method using ontology - OBDG (ontology based dynamic grouping) Method. This method can improve the intelligence of collaborative learning system, and the experiment results show that it can solve the dynamic grouping problem.

AB  - Elevator group control system (EGCS) is a control network that manages several elevators in order to make the transportation system operate efficiently according to the traffic patterns and the service requests. The functions and the features of EGCS are analyzed, and the group control strategies are also discussed in this article. This study sets up an Elevator Group Control Simulation Testbed based on field bus control structure. Microprocessor units are adopted to control the relevant elevator running. With the application of Object Oriented Technology (OOT), group control and supervisory functions are implemented on an industrial computer as group controller. All control modules exchange data via Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. This testbed can be exploited as a platform for group control strategy research.

AB  - In order to increase the efficiency and decrease the cost of machinery diagnosis, a hybrid system of computational intelligence methods is presented. Firstly, the continuous attributes in diagnosis decision system are discretized with the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network. Then, dynamic reductions are computed based on the rough set method, and the key conditions for diagnosis are found according to the maximum cluster ratio. Lastly, according to the optimal reduction, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is designed for fault identification. The diagnosis of a diesel verifies the feasibility of engineering applications.

AB  - In this paper, the authors propose a new model for active contours segmentation in a given image, based on Mumford-Shah functional (Mumford and Shah, 1989). The model is composed of a system of differential and integral equations. By the experimental results we can keep the advantages of Chan and Vese's model (Chan and Vese, 2001) and avoid the regularization for Dirac function. More importantly, in theory we prove that the system has a unique viscosity solution.

AB  - The main objective of an automatic recognition system of celestial objects via their spectra is to classify celestial spectra and estimate physical parameters automatically. This paper proposes a new automatic classification method based on support vector machines to separate non-active objects from active objects via their spectra. With low SNR and unknown red-shift value, it is difficult to extract true spectral lines, and as a result, active objects can not be determined by finding strong spectral lines and the spectral classification between non-active and active objects becomes difficult. The proposed method in this paper combines the principal component analysis with support vector machines, and can automatically recognize the spectra of active objects with unknown red-shift values from non-active objects. It finds its applicability in the automatic processing of voluminous observed data from large sky surveys in astronomy.

AB  - A Soft Thresholding Wavelet-based Radial Basis Function Neural network (STWRBFN) method was developed to perform simultaneous quantitative analysis of multicomponent mixtures. The quality of noise removal and regression was improved by combining wavelet soft thresholding with radial basis function neural network. Through optimization, the wavelet function, wavelet decomposition level (L), thresholding method and spread parameter sigma of RBFN were selected. Two-programs, i.e. PSTWRBFN and PRBFN, were designed to perform STWRBFN and RBFN calculations. Experimental results showed the STWRBFN method to be successful and better than RBFN. Comparing with classical multivariate linear regression, both the methods were more powerful.

AB  - Traditional Chinese medicine has developed over more than 4000 years. A tremendous amount of medical knowledge has been accumulated, among which herbal drugs and formulae are an important portion. This paper presents an ontology for traditional Chinese drugs and formulae, and an ontology-based system for extracting knowledge of drugs and formulae from semi-structured text. The system consists of two components: an executable knowledge extraction language (or EKEL) for specifying knowledge-extracting agents, and a support machine for executing EKEL programs. Experiments show that the system is adequate of extracting knowledge of herbal drugs and formulae from semi-structured text. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The local fuzzy fractal dimension (LFFD) is proposed to extract local fractal feature of medical images. The definition of LFFD is an extension of the pixel-covering method by incorporating the fuzzy set. Multi-feature edge detection is implemented with the LFFD and the Sobel operator. The LFFD can also serve as a characteristic of motion in medical image sequences. The experimental results show that the LFFD is an important feature of edge areas in medical images and can provide information for segmentation of echocardiogram image sequences. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as a complete knowledge system researches into human health conditions via a different approach compared to orthodox medicine. We are developing a unified traditional Chinese medical language system (UTCMLS) through an ontology approach that will support TCM language knowledge storage, concept-based information retrieval and information integration. UTCMLS is a huge knowledge project, which is a broad collaboration of 16 distributed groups, most of them with no prior experience of formal ontology development. Therefore, the cooperative and comprehensive ontology engineering is crucial. We use Protégé 2000 for ontology development of concepts and relationships that represent the domain and that will permit storage of TCM knowledge. This paper focuses on the methodology, design and development of ontology for UTCMLS. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel method for prediction on load carrying capacity of corroded R.C. beam (CRCB) is presented in the paper. According to the flexural test results of the CRCBs, it is discovered that the distribution of surface cracks on the beams shows on fractal behavior. The relationship between fractal dimensions and mechanical properties in CRCBs is then studied. A prediction model based on artificial neural network (ANN) is established by the use of the fractal dimension as corrosion index, together with the basic information of the beam. The validity of the prediction model is demonstrated through the experimental data, and the satisfactory results are achieved.

AB  - Protein structure prediction is one of the most important problems in modern computational biology. Protein secondary structure prediction is a key step in prediction of protein tertiary structure. There have emerged many methods based on machine learning techniques, such as neural networks (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) etc., to focus on the prediction of the secondary structures. In this paper, a new method was proposed based on SVM. Different from the existing methods, this method takes into account of the physical-chemical properties and structure properties of amino acids. When tested on the most popular dataset CB513, it achieved a Q(3) accuracy of 0.7844, which illustrates that it is one of the top range methods for protein of secondary structure prediction.

AB  - In MANETs the routing problem is a challenging issue; in this paper we take a novel approach to the routing problem in MANETs by using swarm intelligence inspired algorithms. The proposed algorithm is proactive algorithm, it uses ant-like agents to dynamically discover and maintain paths in a MANET. The simulation results show that the Swarm-intelligence based on routing algorithm is robust to mobility in limited bandwidth overhead, and can be used effectively for MANET.

AB  - Learning in synergetic pattern recognition is a process by which prototype vectors and adjoint vectors are calculated. A new kernel-based learning algorithm was presented. Input data are implicitly mapped into a high-dimensional feature space in which the patterns are more separable. The samples are represented as adjoint vectors on which an additive constraint is imposed to avoid the norm value of them being unreasonable large. The experimental results of applying the scheme to characters demonstrate its efficiency, and the calculated order parameters used in subsequent evolvement represent more truly the similarity between the test pattern and the prototypes.

AB  - This paper advanced a new algorithm to detect network intrusions using sequences of system calls. This algorithm uses a data structure called weight tree, first it uses normal system call trace to build weight tree forest, which have to be pruned periodically in order to learn new pattern and eliminate impurity. Then it scans abnormal trace using those trees and gets the corresponding weight sequences. Those weight sequences can tell us if something abnormal has happened or not. The good experimental results were acquired.

AB  - Nowadays the tremendous amount of data has far exceeded our human ability for comprehension, and this has been particularly true for the medical database. However, traditional statistical techniques are no longer adequate for analyzing this vast collection of data. Knowledge discovery in database and data mining play an important role in analyzing data and uncovering important data patterns. This paper briefly presents the concepts of knowledge discovery in database and data mining, then describes the rough set theory, and gives some examples based on rough set.

AB  - The set of frequent closed patterns determines exactly the complete set of all frequent patterns and is usually much smaller than the latter. Yet mining frequent closed patterns remains to be a memory and time consuming task. The compound frequent item set tree is employed to organize the set of frequent patterns, which consumes much less memory than other structures. The tree is grown quickly by integrating depth first and breadth first search strategies, opportunistically choosing between two different structures to represent projected transaction subsets, and heuristically deciding to build unfiltered pseudo or filtered projections. Efficient pruning methods are used to reduce the search space. The balance of the efficiency and scalability of tree growth and pruning maximizes the performance. The experimental results show that the algorithm is a factor of five to three orders of magnitude more time efficient than several recently proposed algorithms, and is also the most scalable one. It can be used in the discovery of non-redundant association rules, sequence analysis, and many other data mining problems.

AB  - By using the overlapping sensitivity of chemical gas sensors, an artificial olfactory system based on a telepresence robotic system, combing a chemical gas sensor array with self organizing map (SOM) neural networks, is constructed to qualitatively analyze chemical gases. The SOM neural networks have the remarkable capability of transforming the hyperspace characteristics of input gas into a two dimensional map, consequently the gas can be discriminated. Experimental results show that the system increases the selectivity of gas sensors and the SOM neural network is feasible for gas discrimination.

AB  - This paper presents an intelligent methodology for diagnosing incipient faults in rotating machinery. In this fault diagnosis system, wavelet transform techniques are used in combination with a function approximation model to extract fault features. Wavelet neural networks are also constructed. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: First, a wavelet theory based on a nonlinear adaptive algorithm is developed for an excitation function approximation of neural networks. Preprocessing of a single fault signal is required to perform diagnosis using an intelligent system. Second, a neural network classifier for identifying the faults is developed. The system is scalable to different rotating machinery and has been successfully demonstrated with a turbine generator unit. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is a complex discrete-event dynamic system. Based on the extended high level evaluation Petri Net (EHLEP-N) , the extended high level global evaluation Petri Net (EHLGEP-N) with global structure is proposed to model FMS. The combination of EHLGEP-N with the genetics-based minimum balance (GMB) algorithm is taken as an example to address that combining EHLGEP-N with intelligently optimal methods improves not only the integral performance of FMS optimal scheduling but also the visibility of the scheduling.

AB  - Peer-to-Peer systems are emerging as one of the most popular Internet applications. Structured Peer-to-Peer overlay networks use identifier based routing algorithms to allow robustness, load balancing, and distributed lookup needed in this environment. However, identifier based routing that is independent of Internet topology tends to be of low efficiency. Aimed at improving the routing efficiency, the super-proximity routing algorithms presented in this paper combine Internet topology and overlay routing table in choosing the next hop. Experimental results showed that the algorithms greatly improve the efficiency of Peer-to-Peer routing.

AB  - Reverse engineering in the manufacturing field is a process in which the digitized data are obtained from an existing object model or a part of it, and then the CAD model is reconstructed. This paper presents an RBF neural network approach to modify and fit the digitized data. The centers for the RBF are selected by using the orthogonal least squares learning algorithm. A mathematically known surface is used for generating a number of samples for training the networks. The trained networks then generated a number of new points which were compared with the calculating points from the equations. Moreover, a series of practice digitizing curves are used to test the approach. The results showed that this approach is effective in modifying and fitting digitized data and generating data points to reconstruct the surface model.

AB  - This novel method of Pedestrian Tracking using Support Vector (PTSV) proposed for a video surveillance instrument combines the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier into an optic-flow based tracker. The traditional method using optical flow tracks objects by minimizing an intensity difference function between successive frames, while PTSV tracks objects by maximizing the SVM classification score. As the SVM classifier for object and non-object is pre-trained, there is need only to classify an image block as object or non-object without having to compare the pixel region of the tracked object in the previous frame. To account for large motions between successive frames we build pyramids from the support vectors and use a coarse-to-fine scan in the classification stage. To accelerate the training of SVM, a Sequential Minimal Optimization Method (SMO) is adopted. The results of using a kernel-PTSV for pedestrian tracking from real time video are shown at the end. Comparative experimental results showed that PTSV improves the reliability of tracking compared to that of traditional tracking method using optical flow.

AB  - This paper presents a new efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed itemsets. It enumerates the closed set of frequent itemsets by using a novel compound frequent itemset tree that facilitates fast growth and efficient pruning of search space. It also employs a hybrid approach that adapts search strategies, representations of projected transaction subsets, and projecting methods to the characteristics of the dataset. Efficient local pruning, global subsumption checking, and fast hashing methods are detailed. The principle that balances the overheads of search space growth and pruning is also discussed. Extensive experimental evaluations on real world and artificial datasets showed that our algorithm outperforms CHARM by a factor of five and is one to three orders of magnitude more efficient than CLOSET and MAFIA.

AB  - A new chaos control method is proposed to take advantage of chaos or avoid it. The hybrid Internal Model Control and Proportional Control learning scheme are introduced. In order to gain the desired robust performance and ensure the system's stability, Adaptive Momentum Algorithms are also developed. Through properly designing the neural network plant model and neural network controller, the chaotic dynamical systems are controlled while the parameters of the BP neural network are modified. Taking the Lorenz chaotic system as example, the results show that chaotic dynamical systems can be stabilized at the desired orbits by this control strategy.

AB  - Synchronization of neural networks by mutual learning has been demonstrated to be possible for constructing key exchange protocol over public channel. However, the neural cryptography schemes presented so far are not the securest under regular flipping attack (RFA) and are completely insecure under majority flipping attack (MFA). We propose a scheme by splitting the mutual information and the training process to improve the security of neural cryptosystem against flipping attacks. Both analytical and simulation results show that the success probability of RFA on the proposed scheme can be decreased to the level of brute force attack (BFA) and the success probability of MFA still decays exponentially with the weights' level L. The synchronization time of the parties also remains polynomial with L. Moreover, we analyze the security under an advanced flipping attack.

AB  - Researches on product information model, modeling method and operation method are the key issues for supporting knowledge processing and sharing in modern enterprise. A knowledge-based product information modeling framework was proposed according to the methodology of ontology and semantic Web. There are three layers in the model: object wrapper, middleware, and enterprise application. By introduction of ontology-driven middleware layer, production information semantics were kept consistent and the interoperability between models was enhanced. A mapping method from EXPRESS schema to DAML+OIL was given as the basis of construction of the middleware layer. The advantage of the method was illustrated with an example of product information model in DAML+OIL.

AB  - As a NP-Complete problem, multicast routing with delay constraint is a research difficulty in routing problem. Tabu Search is artificial intelligence algorithm, which is an extension of local search algorithm and has simple realization and well properties. In this paper, an efficient algorithm based on Tabu Search for Delay-Constrained Low-Cost Multicast Routing is proposed to solve delay-constrained multicast routing problem. This problem is known to be NP-Complete. The proposed heuristic algorithm makes use of the characteristics of flexible memory function and tabu rule in TS algorithm, generates neighborhood structure base on 'paths-switching' operations, and finds multicast tree satisfying constraint. A large number of simulations demonstrate that the algorithm performs excellent performance of cost, rapid convergence and stable performance of delay. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Error hypersurfaces are very valuable to study because of their unique status in multilayer perceptron research. Given the architecture of a multilayer perceptron, if the pattern sets are different, so are the respective error hypersurfaces in the multilayer perceptron. Using the theory of groups and Polya Theorem, this paper constructs classes of congruent pattern sets and classes of congruent error hypersurfaces, and proves that the number of classes of congruent pattern sets is equal to the number of congruent error hypersurfaces. Calculation results lead to much fewer classes of congruent error hypersurfaces than the total error hypersurfaces, and show that as the input dimension N increases, the former number increases at a much lower rate than the latter number, thus simplifying the understanding of the complexity of classes of error hypersurfaces.

AB  - This paper introduces a flexible neural tree model. The model is computed as a flexible multi-layer feed-forward neural network. A hybrid learning/evolutionary approach to automatically optimize the neural tree model is also proposed. The approach includes a modified probabilistic incremental program evolution algorithm (MPIPE) to evolve and determine a optimal structure of the neural tree and a parameter learning algorithm to optimize the free parameters embedded in the neural tree. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed method are evaluated using function approximation, time series prediction and system identification problems and compared with the related methods.

AB  - A new method for peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerization prediction based on the theory of support vector machines (SVM) was introduced. The SVM represents a new approach to supervised pattern classification and has been successfully applied to a wide range of pattern recognition problems. In this study, six training datasets consisting of different length local sequence respectively were used. The polynomial kernel functions with different parameter d were chosen. The test for the independent testing dataset and the jackknife test were both carried out. When the local sequence length was 20-residue and the parameter d = 8, the SVM method archived the best performance with the correct rate for the cis and trans forms reaching 70.4 and 69.7% for the independent testing dataset, 76.7 and 76.6% for the jackknife test, respectively. Matthew's correlation coefficients for the jackknife test could reach about 0.5. The results obtained through this study indicated that the SVM method would become a powerful tool for predicting peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerization.

AB  - The system process was modeled and an inverse model controller using support vector machine regression (SVMR) was designed. The SVMR principle was briefly introduced. The SVMR was applied to the internal model control (IMC) problem, and the SVMR internal model was developed. An SVMR controller for internal model control problem was proposed under the inverse condition of control process. The control algorithm was applied to the reversible nonlinear system and greenhouse environment with unknown disturbance and was compared with neural networks IMC using simulation, and the results showed that the SVMR IMC had a simplified model and good control performance.

AB  - The multi-model solution proposed by A. Duchateau et al is a further extension of the OGY method. In order to increase the zones of effective control (ZECs) of the attractor, a series of local linear models and control laws were positioned along an uncontrolled convergent trajectory that could direct the chaotic process towards its fixed point. So, controllers with both variable structure and parameter were required. A control method was presented that the control laws of multi-model solution were generated by artificial immune algorithm to obtain double plasticity of parameter and structure. The simulation results showed that the method could control the chaotic system towards its desired trajectory in less chaotic transient time than it used to be. The proposed approach is applicable to the systems with unknown dynamic model and known experimental data.

AB  - Internal force control is the main challenge in internal/motion control of multiple manipulators. Based on the assumption of point contact model, the internal force adaptive control of multiple manipulators with unknown parameters was addressed. Some special characters of the complete system formed by multiple manipulators were presented. The relationship between the internal force error and dynamical parameters was derived. A composite adaptive controller to deal with the internal force error was provided when the condition PE (persistent-exciting) was not satisfied. By theoretical prove and simulation, it was shown that the proposed controller could realize simultaneously both the desired position trajectory of the object and desired value of the internal force.

AB  - The parameter estimation in sintering process of plumbum and zinc smelting is a concerned challenge for the complexity in chemical reactions. The idea of intelligent integrated modeling strategy was to combine multiple modeling techniques to acquire all kinds of information from the plant. The study of estimation of sulfur content in agglomerate was vital for operation optimization. An estimation model for sulfur estimation based on intelligent integrated strategy is put forward, in which the mathematical model calculates the sulfur content in agglomerate following material balance equation with some unsolvable parameters estimated by neural network method, while the expert rule model describes the relationship between sulfur quantity and key factors. An intelligent coordinator based on fuzzy logic is proposed to synthesize the output of the models. The estimation model is tested by industrial practical data, and its average error is 7.5%. So this model could be used as a guide in practical operation in sintering process.

AB  - It is a new attempt to apply the case based reasoning (CBR) method to the pattern CAD domain. This paper presents a case based model for pattern design. We first decompose the pattern into pattern elements, and represents the pattern case by frame-based case structure and element-based case data, then the procedure of pattern design is modeled as the case-making process of specific pattern case frame aiming to various pattern elements. We also present some new solving strategy for the key techniques used in CBR, such as the organization and query mechanics of case base, case adoption and re-design of case etc. Meanwhile, the conductive interaction technique based on design context and the knowledge-based promotion from local operation to global layout are applied successfully in the model. Running the prototype system shows that CBR is an effective approach for the design of serial and regular pattern.

AB  - A heuristic algorithm based on fabu search technology, routing and wavelength assignment (RWA)-TS-P, which developed from the local search greedy algorithm RWA-greedy, was proposed to solve the optimal design for WDM networks. RWA-TS-P introduces power examining procedure to guarantee the availability of all the lightpaths to be established within the network. Experimental results in ring and mesh networks are given, which show the good performance and controllable calculation complexity of the heuristic algorithm.

AB  - For solving the temporal-relating planning and scheduling problem, a dynamic algorithm is proposed based on temporal constraints network (TCN). Unlike the traditional work in all shortest path algorithm, this algorithm only computes the partial network influenced by the new introduced constraint rather than the whole network. The worst time complexity of the algorithm (O (2ne)) is given and proved. Taken the typical Job -Shop scheduling problem as an example, the simulation system is designed to verify the proposed algorithm, and the result has shown that it can quickly judge the consistence of the constraints and work out the earliest start time of the operator.

AB  - Breaking point in the field of image fusion is placed on the application of neurodynamics of vision models, esp. on research work about the characteristics of the bimodal cells of rattlesnakes, since observers (animal or human) are always the last stage of the vision information processing chain. Fusion of images familiar to the color vision perception is likely covered. A fusion system has been built up adopting the ON-center OFF-surround and OFF-center ON-surround opponent property structure throughout the entire vision processing. The advances and prospects of the visual/IR color image fusion based on the rattlesnake bimodal cell neurodynamics are given and some research work about this field are described.

AB  - An intelligent decision support system (IDSS) is developed for high-building structural form selection. Microsoft Access 2000 for Windows is used as a foreground-developing tool for building case base system, while MATLAB 5.3 for Windows is used as a background-computing tool for numerical computation. The system includes case base system (CBS), scheme generation system (SGS), scheme evaluation system (SES) and scheme choice system (SCS). CBS is built on the techniques of object-oriented programming, SGS is built on the case reasoning based on neural computing, SES is built on fuzzy inference, and SCS is built on fuzzy decision-making. Applications show that the system can supply the decision support for conceptual design of high-rise building.

AB  - An approach for measuring and analyzing the macroscopic movement forms in brain information processing is put forward. The approach does not involve the information processing among individual nerve cells, but only the macroscopic movement forms in brain information processing when the test subjects make simple logical judgments continuously in a specific period according to some specified instructions, it studies the common dynamic characteristics of movement and the individual dynamic characteristics of movement, dealing with relations between the dynamic characteristics of brain information processing and characteristics of human behavior. As human behavior is the macroscopic indirect presentation of brain information processing, the result of this research may be used to detect the ability and character of human behaviors.

AB  - In order to improve the adaptability of language model, the user-oriented language model is proposed consisting of the general-purpose language model (with its original parameters kept unchanged) obtained through large-scale training on balanced corpus and the user model (with its parameters dynamically updated using the first in and first out technique) obtained through on-line learning. In the data storage structure, a multi-level index structure is used in the general-purpose model to solve the data sparseness problem, and the user model is represented by linear structures, and searched by the halving method. A machine learning method suitable for Chinese N-gram model is proposed following the principle of correcting as much language model transfer errors as possible and avoiding language model imbalance. Experimental results indicate that this machine learning method has the strengthening characteristics, and provides a progressive learning mode with more flexible choice for the application system.

AB  - The theory of rough sets can be developed in at least two approaches: constructive and axiomatic approaches, which are complementary to each other. The constructive approach is more suitable for practical applications of rough sets, while the axiomatic approach is appropriate for studying the structures of rough set algebra. The constructive and axiomatic approaches are presented in the study of rough fuzzy set. In the constructive approach, one starts with a binary crisp relation and defines a pair of lower and upper rough fuzzy approximation operators. Different classes of rough fuzzy set algebra are obtained from different types of binary crisp relations. In the axiomatic approach, one defines a pair of dual rough fuzzy approximation operators and states that axioms must be satisfied by the operators. Various classes of rough fuzzy algebra are characterized by different sets of axioms. Axioms of rough fuzzy approximation operators guarantee the existence of certain types of binary crisp relations producing the same rough fuzzy operators.

AB  - An automated fault management system based on distributed intelligent propagation (AFM-DIP) is presented by using the techniques of artificial intelligence and distributed network management. The cooperative agents are introduced to improve the ability of system's data collection. Neural networks and temporary cases database are applied by agents for alarm collection, classification and cases management. The agents diagnose the faults in a domain, and the unsolved problems would be submitted to the management center that will diagnose the fault based on the case based reasoning after analyzing all the information from each domain, and then transmit this case to the agents. The consequent similar faults will be diagnosed directly by the agents, so the efficiency of the fault management is increased. The information and cases sharing can be achieved. The experiment shows that the AFMDIP reduces the bandwidth consume in the management center and speeds up the fault diagnosis process under large-scale and multi-faults situations.

AB  - In this paper, a new method is described to construct rough neural networks. On the base of rough set model, we present a method to develop rough neural network of variable precision and train it using Levenberg-Marquart algorithm. The method is particularly attractive because it combines the advantages of both rough logic networks and neural networks. In our system, weak generalization in rough sets theory and complexity in neural network are avoided while anti-jamming performance is highly improved and the network structure is also simplified. In experiments, the network is applied to classification of remote sensing images. The results show that our method is more effective and successful than application of rough sets and neural network separately.

AB  - A new control scheme for uncalibrated robotic visual tracking problem is proposed that compromises the computational expenses of overall system with offline modeling and online control. A nonlinear visual mapping model for the uncalibrated hand-eye coordination is first proposed with an artificial neural network implementation. An online visual tracking controller is then developed together with a real-time motion planner. To improve the system performance, the control scheme is also integrated with a feedforward controller to compensate unknown object motions. Extensive simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB  - This paper presents the construction of hardware and flow chart of software of an obstacle recurrence and amplification device (ORAD) based on the digital closed-loop modification technology. The digital closed-loop modification technology is creatively applied to the process of the obstacle recurring and amplifying. In addition, the obstacle source data is accurately modified by the sampling feedback data according to the adaptive fuzzy intelligent control algorithm. The proposed two methods enable the ORAD to overcome the waveform's nonlinear distortion which is the drawback of the present devices of the same kind, such as the power amplifier, the relay test system, etc. Therefore the practicability of the ORAD is greatly enhanced.

AB  - A concurrent constraint language COPS has been designed and implemented. It combines the techniques of the constraint objects, non-deterministic computation and constraint store. Inference control based on concurrent constraint model and rule selection policy based on priority are adopted. Declarative representation, systematic and heuristic search capability, and deterministic computation are unified. Preliminary applications on circuit modeling and expert decision systems indicate its applicability in information system construction based on constraints. COPS provides possibility for solutions of complex intelligent application problems.

AB  - Skilled individual agents are firm basis of a strong soccer team. The skills available to Everest 2002 agents include kicking, dribbling, forwarding, ball interception and tackling. These intermediate sub goals are implemented by a combination of local optimization which hopes to determine the optimal primitive action from a local perspective and adversarial consideration which takes into account opponents and limitations imposed by simulation environment. Everest 2002 RoboCup simulation teams, building on 11 skilled agents and an on-line coach, won the 2nd place in RoboCup 2002 simulation league.

AB  - Facing complicated objects, how to describe or represent objects is the base to solve questions frequently. This paper introduces a representation of quotient space theory. In the theory, a problem (or problem space) is described by a triplet (X, f, T), in which X is its domain, f is its attributes, T is its structure. Assuming R is an equivalence relation on X, [X] is a quotient set under R. Regarding [X] as a new domain, we have a new problem space ([X], [f], [T]). The worlds with different grain size are represented by a set of quotient space. The representation is intended to describe the worlds with different grain-size easily and can be used for analyzing the hierarchical problem solving behavior expediently. Compared to rough set and decision-making tree, the quotient space has stronger representation. Not only it can represent vectors of the problem domain, different structures between vectors, but also it can define different attribute functions and operations etc. Authors discuss the method how to represent and to partition an object in granular worlds, and educe the relationship of different granular worlds and confirm the degree of granule. Authors also supply two examples of representing granular worlds: A routing for internet and another game of weighing heavy balls. The examples indicate that to describe or represent a complicated object is equal to construct its quotient space.

AB  - An integrated intelligent method for bolt-shotcrete support design in underground rock excavation is presented. Firstly, the expert system and artificial neural network as well as case-based design are applied to predict the parameters for support individually. Then the divisional weight-adapting multi-expert decision algorithm is used to integrate those results given by above artificial intelligent methods and form the last design scheme. The method proposed here can comprehensively consider different artificial intelligent design methods and provide the support parameters which are closest to practice. The method can be used as a practical tool for the support design of underground rock excavation.

AB  - Background: Tumor markers are routinely measured in clinical oncology. However, their value in cancer detection has been controversial largely because no single tumor marker is sensitive and specific enough to meet strict diagnostic criteria. One strategy to overcome the shortcomings of single tumor markers is to measure a combination of tumor markers to increase sensitivity and look for distinct patterns to increase specificity. This study aimed to develop a system for parallel detection of tumor markers as a tool for tumor detection in both cancer patients and asymptomatic populations at high risk Materials and Methods: A protein chip was fabricated with twelve monoclonal antibodies against the following tumor markers respectively: CA125, CA153, CA19-9, CA242, CEA, AFP, PSA, free-PSA, HGH, β-HCG, NSE and ferritin. Tumor markers were captured after the protein chip was incubated with serum samples. A secondary antibody conjugated with HRP was used to detect the captured tumor markers using chemiluminescence technique. Quantification of the tumor markers was obtained after calibration with standard curves. Results: The chip system showed an overall sensitivity of 68.18% after testing 1147 cancer patients, with high sensitivities for liver, pancreas and ovarian tumors and low sensitivities for gastrointestinal tumors, and a specificity of 97.1% after testing 793 healthy individuals. Application of the chip system in physical checkups of 15,867 individuals resulted in 16 cases that were subsequently confirmed as having cancers. Analysis of the detection results with a Support Vector Machine algorithm considerably increased the specificity of the system as reflected in healthy individuals and hepatitis/cirrhosis patients, but only modestly decreased the sensitivity for cancer patients. Conclusion: This protein chip system is a potential tool for assisting cancer diagnosis and for screening cancer in high-risk populations.

AB  - By using some analytic techniques, several simple criteria are derived for the global exponential stability of delayed bi-directional associative memory (BAM) neural networks. Our results throw off the usual assumption that the activation function is of bounded character. Exponential converging velocity indexes are provided, which depend on the transmission delays and system parameters. A numerical example is also given to show the correctness of our analysis. These results have an important instructional significance in the design of exponential stable delayed BAM circuits. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to solve ill-posed constrained optimization efficiently, an artificial immune algorithm (AIA) imitating biological immune systems and its approach are presented, several artificial immune operators producing new antibodies are constituted, and the global convergence of the algorithm is studied. AIA succeeds to the mechanism of the survival of the fittest, but the methods producing new antibodies are more varied than ones producing new individuals in genetic algorithm (GA). If the best of all antibodies is made sure into next antibody colony as selecting antibodies, AIA is global convergent. A simulation text of 100-city TSP is done with AIA, and its computational process is compared with that of genetic algorithm. The results show that AIA is more efficient than GA in global optimization and computational process of AIA is faster than that of GA.

AB  - This paper develops a meeting scheduling system based on multi-agent negotiation. With adaptive negotiation strategy adopted, agents are able to determine optimized search bias according to his private calendar profile and choose time sections to negotiate. In addition, the strategy of conflict resolution is dividing invitees into two types: VIPs and normal invitees, as well as canceling meeting mechanism. The obtained result shows that these will improve system efficiency of negotiation and ability of resolving conflicts, and thus decrease the communications during negotiation process.

AB  - Resources are the bases of human life. Energy is the characteristic resource in industrial age and therefore, the law of energy transform and conservation became the solid foundation of science and technology in modern time. Information is the characteristic resource in information age and thus the transformational and unified theory of information, knowledge, strategy and its execution will be the soul of science and technology development in information age. The concepts and the mechanism of information, knowledge, strategy and its execution will be explained and the unified theory of information, knowledge, strategy and its execution can thus be established within which the information theory has yet greatly gone beyond Shannon theory. The knowledge theory has also dramatically extended from knowledge engineering. The three existing approaches of intelligence theory, the neural networks approach, the expert systems approach, and the sensor-motor approach, are integrated into a uniform system. The unified theory will provide new vision and new vigor for the further development of intelligence science.

AB  - The main technology for line interpreting of polyhedra image is the Huffman method. By testing Huffman method of line interpreting, its undoubted shortcomings are discovered: It cannot distinguish some kinds of objects, and its mark system has some interior contradictions. These problems are solved by making some changes to Huffman mark model and by developing a priority-rank model for mark choosing.

AB  - The pheromone-based ant routing algorithm is a distributed routing algorithm with good scalability and robustness. A 2-D cellular automata (CA) model of the computer network was presented to analyze the algorithm. The results show that the procedure of establishing a stable route is self-organized towards the attractive peculiar state, and the duration of time for the routing establishment is power-law distributed. A practical ant routing protocol over an IP network was presented, and two simulations were done to compare the performance dynamic and the load balancing performance between this protocol and the open shortest path first (OSPF) protocol. The results show that the ant routing protocol out-performs the OSPF in these aspects.

AB  - This paper describes the implementation and performance of the virtual assembly support system (VASS), a system that can provide designers and assembly process engineers with a simulation and visualization environment where they can evaluate the assembly-ability/disassembly-ability of products, and thereby use a computer to intuitively create assembly plans and interactively generate assembly process charts. Subassembly planning and assembly priority reasoning techniques were utilized to find heuristic information to improve the efficiency of assembly process planning. Tool planning was implemented to consider tool requirements in the product design stage. New methods were developed to reduce the computation mount involved in interference checking. As an important feature of the VASS, human interaction was integrated into the whole process of assembly process planning, extending the power of computer reasoning by including human expertise, resulting in better assembly plans and better designs.

AB  - Multi-agent system (MAS) theory has raised more and more attention from researchers and is experiencing a rapid development in recent years. Many methods based on MAS are emerged and proved successful in solving certain problems, and the AER (Agent-environment-rules) model is one of them used in solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). But the statistic strategy for Agents constrains its ability in problem solving. To tackle this problem, simulated annealing (SA) is introduced to provide Agents with more active and effective strategies. Thus, the application of MAS and SA is successfully combined to form an effective model, SAAER (simulated annealing based AER) model, for solving the CSPs. Results from experiments on the classical CSPs, such as TV-queen and coloring problems, show that SAAER model can solve the CSPs at a more effective and stable level. For a large-scale TV-queen problem, when N=10000, a precise solution can be obtained in about 200 seconds.

AB  - Coal-fired boiler operation is confronted with two requirements to reduce its operation cost and lower its emission. In order to improve the efficiency and reduce the emission in combustion, a model of a coal-fired boiler for NOx emission and efficiency response characteristics is needed. Such a model is quite difficult, due to the huge boiler architecture, complicated operating conditions, coal sort variation and etc.. Based on the data of optimal combustion experiment, a approach to combine neural network with function-type mode is developed, which results in a mixed model of NOx emission and boiler efficiency response characteristics model. Based on the model, we apply decimal genetic algorithm to solve the control problem of high efficiency and low emission boiler combustion. The solution shows that the proposed optimal algorithm may provide feasible optimal control strategy to regulate wind door aperture according to different optimal object of NOx emission and boiler efficiency.

AB  - Based on the clonal selection theory, the main mechanisms of clone used in the field of artificial intelligence are analyzed in this paper. An improved evolutionary strategies algorithm, immunity poly-clonal strategy algorithm (IPSA), is put forward. Compared with the classical evolutionary strategies (CES), IPSA is shown to be an evolutionary strategy capable of solving complex machine learning tasks, like multi-objective optimization, and the results are better. Using the theories of Markov chain, it is proved that IPSA is convergent.

AB  - In this paper, multiagent systems and genetic algorithms are integrated to form a new algorithm, multiagent genetic algorithm (MAGA), for solving the global numerical optimization problem. An agent in MAGA represents a candidate solution to the optimization problem in hand. All agents live in a latticelike environment, with each agent fixed on a lattice-point. In order to increase energies, they compete or cooperate with their neighbors, and they can also use knowledge. Making use of these agent-agent interactions, MAGA realizes the purpose of minimizing the objective function value. Theoretical analyzes show that MAGA converges to the global optimum. In the first part of the experiments, ten benchmark functions are used to test the performance of MAGA, and the scalability of MAGA along the problem dimension is studied with great care. The results show that MAGA achieves a good performance when the dimensions are increased from 20-10,000. Moreover, even when the dimensions are increased to as high as 10,000, MAGA still can find high quality solutions at a low computational cost. Therefore, MAGA has good scalability and is a competent algorithm for solving high dimensional optimization problems. To the best of our knowledge, no researchers have ever optimized the functions with 10,000 dimensions by means of evolution. In the second part of the experiments, MAGA is applied to a practical case, the approximation of linear systems, with a satisfactory result.

AB  - In this paper, the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point and absolute stability of a class of neural networks with partially Lipschitz continuous activation functions are investigated. The neural networks contain both variable and unbounded delays. Using the matrix property, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point of the neural networks is obtained. By constructing proper vector Liapunov functions and nonlinear integro-differential inequalities involving both variable delays and unbounded delay, using M-matrix theory, sufficient conditions for absolutely exponential stability are obtained. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is a special connection mode of even a higher reliability known as the switching station network in the urban MV distribution network apart from the substation direct supply connection modes. First the optimum number and location of switching stations are determined based on the spatial GIS of the distribution network. Then the method of substation locating and capacity calculating is adopted followed by the development of the automatic routing of the incoming lines and outgoing lines of switching stations based on the automatic routing of multi-sectioned and multi-linked network. After this, the general method of automatic routing of manifold connection modes under the condition of different load densities is proposed. It is shown from an analysis of the example that the method proposed is feasible.

AB  - The spectrometric method to diagnose the wear of frictional parts based on artificial neural network (ANN) was established on the basis of analyzing commonly used spectrometric localization diagnosis methods. Thus the training samples were established using the elemental compositions of the frictional pair materials as the inputs of ANN and the corresponding frictional parts as the outputs of ANN. The diagnosis of the wear failure locations was realized by coordinating the training samples, training the ANN and making use of the powerful non-linear mapping ability and the error-tolerating ability of the ANN. The precision and the feasibility of the established diagnosis method were validated by the analysis of some examples. It was found that the established diagnosis method was applicable to diagnose the wear status of frictional parts with convenience and good precision. Cr4Mo4V, 2Cr3WMoV-1, 1Cr18Ni9Ti, H62 and QA10 are taken for example in the research and analysis.

AB  - A general scheme of cooperative hunting for a moving target by multiple mobile robots in continuous unknown environments is presented. Hunting consists of encircling the target and closing to it, and the encircling behavior is realized with reinforcement learning algorithm. States are clustered in order to reduce the state space, Q learning algorithm is used to get the table of Q values, then the available action is selected according to the Q value table. Hunting of mobile target is realized with synthesized behavior, obtained by summarizing the outputs of all behaviors weighted. Hunting effects in different conditions are verified by simulation, and the results show that environments, velocity relationships between hunter and prey, and the escaping strategies of prey all have their effects on the result.

AB  - Terminal-sensitive projectile is an advanced new-type of ammunition with complex structure and a multiplicity of influencing factors, the overall optimal design to the terminal-sensitive projectile system is thus a very difficult work. Neural network and genetic algorithm were used in this paper, because of the highly non-linear reflecting capability of neural network and the overall optimizing ability of genetic algorithm. The working principle of terminal-sensitive projectile was introduced, and a project of optimal design was confirmed. Using theory of neural network and orthogonal experiments, a simulating model of terminal-sensitive projectile system efficiency was established. On this basis, using a hybrid genetic algorithm, an optimal design to the neural network simulation model was carried out. From it an optimal arrangement of several main factors affecting the system efficiency was obtained. Validation to the above optimal results was then done, and some conclusions about this optimal design formed, showing that the optimal arrangement of those influencing factors are wholly in accordance with the actual state, and that the method can provide scientific foundations for the future efficiency Res. of terminal-sensitive projectile systems.

AB  - Teamwork is an effective way of cooperative problem solving in dynamic and unpredictable application contexts. The concept of joint intention is the key of teamwork. How various speech actions can be used by software Agents to form, maintain and dissolve joint intention is a significant problem needed to be investigated. This paper aims to design a teamwork protocol based on FIPA (foundation for intelligent physical Agent) ACL (Agent communication language) which is a promising Agent communication language. To this aim, the sufficiency of the FIPA ACL in supporting Agents to form the required joint intention in teamwork is analyzed first. Specifically, the notions of the joint-request and delegation-request are distinguished and the insufficiency of the delegation-request in supporting teamwork is pointed out. Thus a new joint-request action is defined to extend the FIPA ACL. Some properties of the joint-request are also discussed. Based on the defined action, a teamwork protocol with a formal semantic description is proposed and its application is demonstrated finally. The teamwork protocol describes a new interaction pattern, which differs from those of the existing elementary request protocol, contract-net protocol and auction protocols within the FIPA Interaction Protocol Specifications. The proposed protocol can facilitate the design of interaction modules in multi-Agent teamwork.

AB  - A key problem of computer numerical control machine tool switching was investigated, which was to determine the jobs' sequence and tool loading policy in order to minimize the total number of tool switches in the planning periodic horizon. In order to search for the optimizing solutions of tool switching problem effectively, a beam search based heuristic algorithm was put forward for formulating heuristic solution space of the problem. This was done by setting down optimization strategy and simplifying the problem solving to get heuristic algorithm solution. The proposed algorithm was tested against some experimental data, and the results show that the heuristic algorithm has the characteristics of high computational speed, briefness and high efficiency.

AB  - A key step of using gradient descent methods to develop learning algorithms of a regular feedforward fuzzy neural network (FNN) is to differentiate max-min functions, which contain max (∨) and min (∧) operations. The paper aims at several objectives. First, investigate further the differentiation of ∨ - ∧ functions. Second, employ general fuzzy numbers, which include triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers as special cases to define a three-layer regular FNN. The general fuzzy numbers related can be approximately determined by their corresponding finite level sets. So, we can approximately represent the input-output (I/O) relationship of the regular FNN as functions of the endpoints of all finite level sets. Third, a fuzzy back-propagation algorithm is presented. And to speed up the convergence of the learning algorithm, a fuzzy conjugate gradient algorithm for fuzzy weights and biases is developed, furthermore, the convergence of the algorithm is analyzed, systematically. Finally, some real simulations demonstrate the efficiency of our learning algorithms. The regular FNN is applied to the approximate realization of fuzzy inference rules and fuzzy functions defined on given compact sets.

AB  - An image retrieval framework that integrates efficient region-based representation in terms of storage and complexity and effective on-line learning capability is proposed. The framework consists of methods for region-based image representation and comparison, indexing using modified inverted files, relevance feedback, and learning region weighting. By exploiting a vector quantization method, both compact and sparse (vector) region-based image representations are achieved. Using the compact representation, an indexing scheme similar to the inverted file technology and an image similarity measure based on Earth Mover's Distance are presented. Moreover, the vector representation facilitates a weighted query point movement algorithm and the compact representation enables a classification-based algorithm for relevance feedback. Based on users' feedback information, a region weighting strategy is also introduced to optimally weight the regions and enable the system to self-improve. Experimental results on a database of 10000 general-purposed images demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB  - This paper presents a multi-agent systems (MAS) based approach and adopts a coordinative optimization method to realize real-time global optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) for large-scale power systems. The ORPD problem is one of the combinatorial optimization problems with characteristics of multi-objective, -uncertainty, -restriction, -extremum and non-linear property. It becomes more and more complicated with the increasing of power system scale. Distributed solving method is promising to this problem. The main idea of MAS is to generate approximate solutions to very complex problems, such as ORPD, by distributing them to autonomous problem solvers, namely agents. These agents solve local ORPD problems by themselves asynchronously and localize dispatch and control. By coordinating in a communication environment, a solution could be found to the global ORPD problem rapidly. Test results show that the proposed MAS based approach performed well in real-time global ORPD of large-scale power systems. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A new kind of optimal fuzzy PID controller is proposed, which contains two parts. One is an on-line fuzzy inference mechanism and another is a conventional PID controller. In the fuzzy inference mechanism, three adjustable factors xp, xi, and xd are introduced. Their function is to further modify and optimize the result of the fuzzy inference to make the controller have the optimal control effect on a given object. The optimal values of these factors are determined based on the ITAE criterion and the flexible polyhedron search algorithm of Nelder and Mead. This PID controller has been used to control a D.C. motor of the intelligent artificial leg designed by the authors. The result of computer simulation indicates that the design of this controller is very effective and can be widely used to control different kinds of objects and processes.

AB  - To fulfill the fault diagnosis under dynamic environment, a distributed fault diagnosis model was presented based on multi-agents for constant and dynamic conditions. As a distributed remote multi-agent diagnosis system, the model consisted of several widely distributed Agent Workgroups. This model was mainly made up of the diagnosis-agent and the management-agent. The former was composed of multi-sensors information fusion algorithm while the latter functions through blackboard model. Then, the fault diagnosis under dynamic environment was realized through communication and cooperation among various agents. Finally, by analyzing an experiment result, it is shown that the model is effective.

AB  - Knowledge of all requirements and constraints during the early phase of a product design is usually imprecise, vague, and difficult to describe formally. It is crucial for the conceptual design to establish functional structure, found the process of design model, and produce multi-solutions. This paper presented functional structure of mechanical product, established functional parameters, and determined a matrix model by use of bond graph fundamental elements. Then, functional means tree was produced by effort-flow transforming operation, and multi-solution production and evaluation were utilized by artificial intelligent technique. At last, an example of the design synthesis was presented to show an application in special purpose jig device of machining center.

AB  - Bis(2,2,6,6-teramethyl-4-piperidinyl) maleate(BPM) is a key intermediate for preparing new types of hindered amine light stabilizers. The authors had developed new technology for synthesizing BPM from dimethyl maleate and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinol with zeolite supported tetraisopropyl titanate as catalyst. The optimal reaction conditions were determined through orthogonal design. Using the experimental data of the orthogonal design as training sample set, a new model was constructed by improved back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN). When the BP-ANN model could approximate to the variational regularities of orthogonal design, widened the range of the most factors level, then using the 988 kinds combinations of all widened factors at different levels as simulation input sample, the optimal reaction technological conditions for synthesizing BPM can be obtained by trained BP-ANN model. Under the conditions, 5 times laboratory-scale test and 5 times pilot-plant test in 10 L reactors were performed, the average yield reaches 96.6%. The experimental results are in good agreement with the predicted yield which is 96.8%.

AB  - A finite element software, finite element program generator (FEPG), is introduced and its designing thought and organizing structure are presented. FEPG uses the method of components and the technique of artificial intelligence to generate finite element program automatically by a computer according to the general principles of mathematic and internal rules of finite element method, as is similar to the deduction of mathematics. FEPG breaks through the limitation of present finite element software, which only applies to special discipline, while FEPG is suitable for all kinds of differential equations solved by finite element method. Now FEPG has been applied to superconductor research, electromagnetic field study, petroleum exploration, transportation, structure engineering, water conservancy, ship mechanics, solid-liquid coupling problems and liquid dynamics, etc. in China.

AB  - The reasoning nonmonotonicity system based on the penalty-function presented by Gadi Pinkes did not reflect the human intelligence when applied to the problem of the intelligent route planning and the coal cutting machine fault diagnosis. So the method of constructing the penalty-function based on the voting principles is presented, and experimental results show that it is more reasonable and effective than Gadi Pinkes' theory.

AB  - Unlike other biometrics such as fingerprints and face, the distinct aspect of iris comes from randomly distributed features. This leads to its high reliability for personal identification, and at the same time, the difficulty in effectively representing such details in an image. This paper describes an efficient algorithm for iris recognition by characterizing key local variations. The basic idea is that local sharp variation points, denoting the appearing or vanishing of an important image structure, are utilized to represent the characteristics of the iris. The whole procedure of feature extraction includes two steps: 1) a set of one-dimensional intensity signals is constructed to effectively characterize the most important information of the original two-dimensional image; 2) using a particular class of wavelets, a position sequence of local sharp variation points in such signals is recorded as features. We also present a fast matching scheme based on exclusive OR operation to compute the similarity between a pair of position sequences. Experimental results on 2255 iris images show that the performance of the proposed method is encouraging and comparable to the best iris recognition algorithm found in the current literature.

AB  - As a global feature of fingerprints, the orientation field is very important for automatic fingerprint recognition. Many algorithms have been proposed for orientation field estimation, but their results are unsatisfactory, especially for poor quality fingerprint images. In this paper, a model-based method for the computation of orientation field is proposed. First a combination model is established for the representation of the orientation field by considering its smoothness except for several singular points, in which a polynomial model is used to describe the orientation field globally and a point-charge model is taken to improve the accuracy locally at each singular point. When the coarse field is computed by using the gradient-based algorithm, a further result can be gained by using the model for a weighted approximation. Due to the global approximation, this model-based orientation field estimation algorithm has a robust performance on different fingerprint images. A further experiment shows that the performance of a whole fingerprint recognition system can be improved by applying this algorithm instead of previous orientation estimation methods.

AB  - This paper presents an algorithm for classifying single-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) during the preparation of self-paced tapping. It combines common spatial subspace decomposition with Fisher discriminant analysis to extract features from multichannel EEG. Three features are obtained based on Bereitschafts potential and event-related desynchronization. Finally, a perceptron neural network is trained as the classifier. This algorithm was applied to the data set (self-paced 1s) of "BCI Competition 2003" with a classification accuracy of 84% on the test set.

AB  - An algorithm based on independent component analysis (ICA) is introduced for P300 detection. After ICA decomposition, P300-related independent components are selected according to the a priori knowledge of P300 spatio-temporal pattern, and clear P300 peak is reconstructed by back projection of ICA. Applied to the dataset IIb of BCI Competition 2003, the algorithm achieved an accuracy of 100% in P300 detection within five repetitions.

AB  - Most traditional expert systems are based on symbolic representation and deduction. The problems of undesirable completeness and precision of symbolic representation lead to complex deduction process. Fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) is effective for fuzzy information representation. FCM was used to map system knowledge into fuzzy state sets, then the fixed relationship weight values were transformed into dynamic values by the Relationship Mapping Function. Object-oriented method was used to build a agent model. Agent knowledge was described by inner components and joint weights between them. Inference was carried out by numerical computation instead of symbolic deduction. This reasoning model is easy to implement and is characterized by high applicability.

AB  - Computerized symbolic computation is a new branch of artificial intelligence, with its remarkable feature as the permeation of computer sciences among various fields of science and engineering. Although nonintegrable, Ostrovsky's model is able to describe a variety of mechanical and physical problems, such as the internal or surface waves in the ocean, magnetic sound in plasma, or a certain type of dispersion in an electromagnetic transmission line. In the oceanic environment, for example, this model applies when Coriolis forces are significant.

AB  - Linguistic-value appraisement extensively exists in artificial intelligence and social system. In the appraisement of enterprise human resource, there is a great amount of linguistic-value information. In order to improve the reasonability of the result of appraisement of enterprise human resource, we need to study the methods for processing the linguistic-value information. A 2-stages method is proposed for processing the linguistic-value appraisement of enterprise human resource. At the first stage, we choose the experts familiar with the related field according to the appraisement goal and problem. At the second stage, we combine the appraisement results by D-S evidence theory or LOWA operator according to the nature of linguistic variable.

AB  - The support vector machine, which is a novel algorithm from the machine learning community, was used to develop quantitation and classification models which can be used as a potential screening mechanism for a novel series of COX-2 selective inhibitors. Each compound was represented by calculated structural descriptors that encode constitutional, topological, geometrical, electrostatic, and quantum-chemical features. The Heuristic method was then used to search the descriptor space and select the descriptors responsible for activity. Quantitative modelling results in a nonlinear, seven-descriptor model based on SVMs with root mean-square errors of 0.107 and 0.136 for training and prediction sets, respectively. The best classification results are found using SVMs: the accuracy for training and test sets is 91.2% and 88.2%, respectively. This paper proposes a new and effective method for drug design and screening. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - In view of the necessity for further improvement of the existing dispatching operation order system (DOOS) with respect to the off-line individual agent, lack of intelligence, security verification and serialized examination, this paper proposes a approach by setting up the operation rules template and user maintainable mechanism to solve the description and learning of operation rules and realize general reasoning. A multi-agent-system-based approach to incorporating SCADA with DOOS to provide real-time information to the security analysis of DOOS, and with dispatching management information system (DMIS) to complete switching on the Intranet is presented. A intelligent DOOS has been developed and implemented in a provincial electric network dispatching center with the automatic and intelligent manual generating switching orders, switching simulation, serialized examination and approval, and execution and management integrated into an organic whole and capable of user maintenance. It has been proved in practice that the system developed has dramatically improved the intelligence and security of dispatching operation and is remarkable in terms of universality and user maintainability.

AB  - At present as an optimized algorithm based on artificial intelligence, genetic algorithm is widely used in generation expansion planning. However, due to complicated operation, huge calculating, degeneration and immature convergence the utilization of genetic algorithm in practice is limited. Here, a modified immune algorithm (MIA) based on divided natural coding is proposed by which the calculation amount of generation expansion planning can be considerably reduced and the computational efficiency can also be improved, the solution of the planning can be flexibly achieved by character information. The proposed algorithm possesses global multiamplitude search ability and excellent convergence, so the phenomena of degeneration and paedogenesis can be avoided. The results of calculation examples show that this algorithm can be used to solve the generation expansion planning and it can be further developed too.

AB  - Black start is an effective measurement to restore the power system when a serious black out occurs. By combination of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and conventional numerical analytical methods, a black start decision support system for the Southern Power Network of Hebei Province is developed. By applying the AI technology, the database of network topology is quickly searched, and then the black start initial schemes are formed. Considering various kinds of technical problems involved in the black start process, several numerical analysis programs are integrated in the system to validate and evaluate the initial schemes. The qualified schemes are therefore sorted by an index which indicates the advantages of each scheme. With the help of the developed system, the operators can easily modify the black start schemes in time, according to the practical condition of the power system.

AB  - To model senior commanders' decision-making, a method based on likelihood ratio was adopted, and for junior commanders, a method based on fuzzy logic was used to model their decision-making. The method based on likelihood ratio could fuse the information from different sources so as to make a reasonable decision output. The method based on fuzzy logic could get its decision outputs from the commanders' personal characters, experience and the environment in battle field and these outputs were taken as the information sources for the senior commanders' decision-making model. The application of these methods in designing the navy force of computer generated force system shows that they are effective to model multilevel intelligent decision-making.

AB  - A hybrid model to predict and judge seepage piping occurring was presented by combining the mechanism model and the neural network model. A set of factors, corresponding with the reliable data which had significant effects on the judgment of seepage piping occurring and easy to observe and measure, were filtrated based on the mechanism model from a great number of complex and disorderly observed engineering data. This data as the effective parameters were applied into a modified BP neural network scheme to analyze the characteristics of the seepage piping occurring. The modified BP neural network model combined with a database system was designed as an artificial intelligent method to predict and judge the seepage piping occurring in embankments. The developed neural network model was applied to some practical embankments for judging and forecasting of the possibility of seepage piping failure using the collected data from a number of reservoirs and embankments. The results show that the proposed method is effective.

AB  - The artificial immune network (AIN) has strong self-organizing ability, but its search performance isn't very good. To resolve this problem, genetic operator was applied to act as the main search approach instead of clone hypermutation by introducing the evolution of antibody into algorithm. The improved AIN was applied to extract knowledge, form knowledge base and conduct on-line search of the neural network model of compensate controller in immunized neurocontrol. Simulation results confirm that the search ability of the improved AIN is enhanced; and by introducing the knowledge base, the genetic algorithm can find the optimal model more quickly.

AB  - An algorithm based on orthogonal projection operator was proposed to construct the wave-net with respect to the frames theory of discrete wavelet transforms. Its geometrical rate convergence is demonstrated in the finite Hilbert functional space. The algorithm optimizes the constructional process in view of energy distribution information while remaining the signal's local characteristics in time-frequency domains. An application on fault detection for a fighter verifies its correctness.

AB  - Based on the current intelligent design technology, the methodology of knowledge integration and knowledge application in the process of finish cavity design for hammer forging is introduced, including: knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation and knowledge-based design techniques. The method of object-oriented knowledge representation is elaborated. As an abstract of the rule, each knowledge object is composed of certain number slots, including: relation slot, attribute slot, rule slot and method slot. The relational model of knowledge object for finish forging die cavity design is given. Based on these, a knowledge-based design support system for finish forging die cavity is developed. This prototype system is a design guide system, which provides the right knowledge to support the designer, make decision/selection and design the finish forging die cavity step by step. A case study is shown to illustrate these features of this system.

AB  - This article presents two approaches for automated building of knowledge bases of soil resources mapping. These methods used decision tree and Bayesian predictive modeling, respectively to generate knowledge from training data. With these methods, building a knowledge base for automated soil mapping is easier than using the conventional knowledge acquisition approach. The knowledge bases built by these two methods were used by the knowledge classifier for soil type classification of the Longyou area, Zhejiang Province, China using TM bi-temporal imageries and geographic information system (GIS) data. To evaluate the performance of the resultant knowledge bases, the classification results were compared to existing soil map based on field survey. The accuracy assessment and analysis of the resultant soil maps suggested that the knowledge bases built by these two methods were of good quality for mapping distribution model of soil classes over the study area.

AB  - Many engineering optimization problems frequently encounter continuous variables and discrete variables which add considerably to the solution complexity. Very few of the existing methods can yield a globally optimal solution when the objective functions are non-convex and non-differentiable. This paper presents a hybrid swarm intelligence approach (HSIA) for solving these nonlinear optimization problems which contain integer, discrete, zero-one and continuous variables. HSIA provides an improvement in global search reliability in a mixed-variable space and converges steadily to a good solution. An approach to handle various kinds of variables and constraints is discussed. Comparison testing of several examples of mixed-variable optimization problems in the literature shows that the proposed approach is superior to current methods for finding the best solution, in terms of both solution quality and algorithm robustness.

AB  - Rough set axiomatization is one aspect of rough set study to characterize rough set theory using dependable and minimal axiom groups. Thus, rough set theory can be studied by logic and axiom system methods. The classic rough set theory is based on equivalent relation, but rough set theory based on reflexive and transitive relation (called quasi-ordering) has wide applications in the real world. To characterize topological rough set theory, an axiom group named RT, consisting of 4 axioms, is proposed. It is proved that the axiom group reliability in characterizing rough set theory based on similar relation is reasonable. Simultaneously, the minimization of the axiom group, which requires that each axiom is an equation and each is independent, is proved. The axiom group is helpful for researching rough set theory by logic and axiom system methods.

AB  - Swarm intelligence inspired by the social behavior of ants boasts a number of attractive features, including adaptation, robustness and distributed, decentralized nature, which are well suited for routing in modern communication networks. This paper describes an adaptive swarm-based routing algorithm that increases convergence speed, reduces routing instabilities and oscillations by using a novel variation of reinforcement learning and a technique called momentum. Experiment on the dynamic network shows that adaptive swarm-based routing learns the optimum routing in terms of convergence speed and average packet latency.

AB  - Unique correct correspondence cannot be obtained only by use of gray correlation technique, which describes gray similar degree of feature points between the left and right images too unilaterally. The gray correlation technique is adopted to extract gray correlation peaks as a coarse matching set called multi-peak set. The disparity gradient limited constraint is utilized to optimize the multi-peak set. Unique match will be obtained by calculating the correlation of hybrid matrices consisting of reference differences and disparities from the multi-peak set. Two of the known corresponding points in the left and right images, respectively, are set as a pair of reference points to determine search direction and search scope at first. After the unique correspondence is obtained by calculating the correlation of the hybrid matrices from the multi-peak set, the obtained match is regarded as a new reference point till all feature points in the left (or right) image have been processed. Experimental results proved that the proposed algorithm was feasible and accurate.

AB  - This paper proposes a granular logic, in brief written by G-logic, constructs the systems of approximate reasoning in the G-logic. It defines the G-formula, G-clause and G-literal, and to give the methods of G-resolution in the logic. The soundness theorem of the G-resolution is also proved. The logical formulas are an ordered binary pair. The first element is an assertion and the second is a definable domain or approximations of undefinable domain corresponding to the assertion. The logic is defined on information system IS=(U,A). So the assignment to individual variables in the formulas is an entity on U. The propositions or predicates in the formula are interpreted as attributes in A, hence the meaning set of proposition or predicate is a subset on U. The pair of constructed by attribute and its meaning set together is called as an elementary granule. And the elementary granules are used as G-atoms in the logic. A G-formula in the logic is combined by the G-atoms with granular logical connectives. Satisfibility of the logical formula is that the meaning set corresponding to it is not empty. If the domain of a formula in the logic is undefinable, the formula is discussed in the rough lower and upper approximations of the domain. The study of G-logic opens a new path for applications of classical logic. G-logic provides a better theoretical tool for treating of irregular knowledge. The operation of G-logic involves the decomposing of global and amalgamating of locals, thus it provides a new idea for solving-problem in AI. G-logic is a new generalization of Rough Logic, the truth concept and its operations of the logic is different from the classical logic and all non-standard logic. The logic is both logic and set theory. Thus it may use the logical methods when treating truth values and its operations, and it may also avoid the calculation of literal unifier with set theory approach in the G-resolution. Finally, the validity and feasibility of the G-resolution are illustrated with real examples. The related theorems in machine theorem proving are proposed and the soundness and completeness of the theorem for G-resolution refutation are discussed.

AB  - Due to the incompleteness and complexity of fault diagnosis for power transformer, a specific fault diagnostic model with self-improvement method based on the rough set theory is given. After the statistic analysis on the collected fault examples of oil-immersed transformer, the results were reduced according to rough set theory and then the diagnostic rules were gotten. How to use this model for fault diagnosis under various conditions was described. Especially lacking key information, the reduced decision table may be gotten by synthetically matching the information came from artificial intelligences, i.e. euclid distance, artificial neural network and fuzzy mathematics, and then the diagnosis might be completed by the reduced decision table and the rule set. Meanwhile the effectiveness of this model can be enhanced by the self-improvement method, which is achieved by modifying the decision table through richening training sample. The case studies show it is effective and useful.

AB  - Support vector machines (SVMs) were used to develop QSAR models that correlate molecular structures to their toxicity and bioactivities. The performance and predictive ability of SVM are investigated and compared with other methods such as multiple linear regression and radial basis function neural network methods. In the present study, two different data sets were evaluated. The first one involves an application of SVM to the development of a QSAR model for the prediction of toxicities of 153 phenols, and the second investigation deals with the QSAR model between the structures and the activities of a set of 85 cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors. For each application, the molecular structures were described using either the physicochemical parameters or molecular descriptors. In both studied cases, the predictive ability of the SVM model is comparable or superior to those obtained by MLR and RBFNN. The results indicate that SVM can be used as an alternative powerful modeling tool for QSAR studies.

AB  - By adopting Object-oriented methodologies, an integrated spatiotemporal data model was proposed. The model extended both spatial and temporal abstract data types. In the model, spatiotemporal object was the aggradations of spatial and temporal objects. The changes of spatial object were described by the behaviors of object and indicated by versions of objects. Spatiotemporal semantics of basic relations of objects were discussed through extending temporal character on spatial qualifier. A unified spatial and temporal predicates were proposed to meet the requirements of general spatiotemporal applications.

AB  - In order to enhance the diagnosis ability of the conventional dissolved gas analysis (DGA), this paper proposes a extension diagnosis method for the power transformer fault diagnosis. Firstly, based on matter-element theory in extension theory, a matter-element model is established for qualitatively describing the fault diagnosis problem of power transformer. Secondly, this paper quantitatively calculates the degree of relation of tested power transformer with the faulted characteristic using the extended relation functions. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is proved by 195 fault diagnosis examples of power transformers. The results show that the extension diagnosis method can overcome the drawbacks of the IEC method that cannot diagnose multi-fault and no matching codes for diagnosis. Moreover, it provides high correct diagnosis rate.

AB  - The Comprehensive Information Based Methodology for Natural Language Understanding presented in the paper is an application of the Comprehensive Information (CI) Theory, which was established by the author of the paper years ago for meeting the needs in artificial intelligence research. Different from other works in the field of natural language processing, the major features of the methodology presented in the paper include two folds. Firstly, instead of the syntactic or/and semantic information is used, all components of the comprehensive information are fully utilized for natural language understanding. Secondly, instead of using one or another approach preferably, both the rule-based approach and the statistics-based approach have been complementarily integrated. The successes of the research projects guided by the methodology and completed last few years prove the methodology promising.

AB  - Collaborative editing systems support a group of collaborators to edit or view the same graphics at the same time from geographically dispersed sites connected by communication networks. The multi-versioning technique in collaborative graphics editing system is discussed. This paper puts emphasis on object identification and its strategies, some existing problems. A general object identification solution for these problems is proposed, which solves their object identification and system maintenance between operations with causality relationships, and with identical relationships, that the existing strategies cannot resolve. On the other hand, the size of object identification will become larger and larger with the progress of collaborative editing works and the generation of conflicting operations, thus affect the efficiency of the system. Therefore, some rules suitable to the compression of the object identification is analyzed, an object compression method is presented and its validity is also analyzed. Analysis of some examples and experimental results show that all strategies and algorithms presented in this paper improve the efficiency of the system.

AB  - The combination of conflicting evidences is one of the important issues in Dempster-Shafer theory since the example of Zadeh paradox produced by Dempster's rule of combination was found. There is no solution accepted universally as yet. An approach to handling this problem is proposed. Before adopting the Dempster's rule to combine belief functions, the assignments of mass functions are pretreated by the disturbance of ignorance. The pretreatment is in favor of the normalization of combination. Compared with other alternatives, the new approach is consistent with Dempster's rule in the form and flexible to combination, especially, it can be theoretically explained by the generalized Bayesian formula.

AB  - An extensive database (946 measurements) for the frequency of pulsing flow in trickle beds was established by collecting the experimental results published over past 30 years. A new correlation based on artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the pulsation frequency was developed. Seven dimensionless numbers (groups) employed in the proposed correlation were liquid and gas Reynolds, liquid Weber, liquid Eotvos, gas Froude, and gas Stokes numbers and a bed correction factor. The comparisons of performance reported in the literature and present correlations show that ANN correlation is a significant improvement in predicting pulsation frequency with an average absolute relative error (AARE) of 10% and a standard deviation less than 18%.

AB  - Object recognition with contour invariant extracted by fast Fourier transforms (FFT) is a regular method in polar-log coordinates, but the features extracted are more and the recognition time is lengthy, so a new polar-exponential grid technique was proposed for object recognition. An object in the Cartesian coordinates was mapped into the polar-log coordinates, and the closed contour of the object was transformed into a 1-dimensional curve. The structure feature of the curve was extracted, which included span of the object, area ratio and distribution status of the curve. This rotation, scale, and translation invariant can be used in object recognition. Three 2D objects were learned and recognized by the BP network in the experiment. The recognition result using the structure invariant and the time it took improved over the contour invariant; however, it only can be used for a single moving object without rolling and twisting.

AB  - An artificial immune recognition algorithm is proposed. Inspired by the metaphor of the interaction of antibodies with antigens, it processes the data as antigens, and then gets an antibody memory matrix by inspiring or restraining the activity of antibodies. The ability of data recognition and data structure description can be achieved by the memory matrix. The algorithm has the characteristics of recognition variety and self-adjustment. The experiment results demonstrate that the algorithm has good clustering effect and high recognition rate on R2 space data and iris data.

AB  - Fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) with spatial constraints (FCM is an effective algorithm suitable for image segmentation. Its effectiveness contributes not only to the introduction of fuzziness for belongingness of each pixel but also to exploitation of spatial contextual information. Although the contextual information can raise its insensitivity to noise to some extent, FCMstill lacks enough robustness to noise and outliers and is not suitable for revealing non-Euclidean structure of the input data due to the use of Euclidean distance (L2 norm). In this paper, to overcome the above problems, we first propose two variants, FCM1 and FCM2, of FCMto aim at simplifying its computation and then extend them, including FCM to corresponding robust kernelized versions KFCM KFCM1 and KFCM2 by the kernel methods. Our main motives of using the kernel methods consist in: inducing a class of robust non-Euclidean distance measures for the original data space to derive new objective functions and thus clustering the non-Euclidean structures in data; enhancing robustness of the original clustering algorithms to noise and outliers, and still retaining computational simplicity. The experiments on the artificial and real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithms, especially with spatial constraints, are more effective. © 2004 IEEE.

AB  - This paper proposes a standard method to approach the uncalibrated robotic hand-eye coordination problem that is system configuration- and task-independent. The unknown hand-eye relationship is first modeled as the modeling errors of a dynamic system. An extended state observer is then implemented to estimate summation of the system's modeling error and the system's external disturbances. With the estimation results as the compensation, the system control is accomplished from a nonlinear combination of the system state errors. A universal framework of controller design is provided for decoupled and coupled hand-eye systems of different configurations to execute dynamic tracking task. © 2004 IEEE.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the design of a robotic fish and its motion control algorithms. A radio-controlled, four-link biomimetic robotic fish is developed using a flexible posterior body and an oscillating foil as a propeller. The swimming speed of the robotic fish is adjusted by modulating joint's oscillating frequency, and its orientation is tuned by different joint's deflections. Since the motion control of a robotic fish involves both hydrodynamics of the fluid environment and dynamics of the robot, it is very difficult to establish a precise mathematical model employing purely analytical methods. Therefore, the fish's motion control task is decomposed into two control systems. The online speed control implements a hybrid control strategy and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm. The orientation control system is based on a fuzzy logic controller. In our experiments, a point-to-point (PTP) control algorithm is implemented and an overhead vision system is adopted to provide real-time visual feedback. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. © 2004 IEEE.

AB  - This paper deals with the reliable linear quadratic (LQ) fuzzy control problem for continuous-time nonlinear systems with actuator faults. The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to represent a nonlinear system. By using multiple Lyapunov functions, an improved linear matrix inequality (LMI) method for the design of reliable LQ fuzzy controllers is investigated, which reduces the conservatism of using a single Lyapunov function. The different upper bounds on the LQ performance cost function for the normal and different actuator fault cases are provided. A suboptimal reliable LQ fuzzy controller is given by means of an LMI optimization procedure, which can not only guarantee the stability of the closed-loop overall fuzzy system for all cases, but also provide an optimized upper bound on a weighted average LQ performance cost function. Finally, numerical simulations on the chaotic Lorenz system are given to illustrate the application of the proposed design method. © 2004 IEEE.

AB  - In view of the intelligence knowledge expression and the decision-making in the railroad train traffic control, this paper presents seven conditional attributes: the relative train priority, the relative train punctuality, the relative train-covered distance, the train section margin, the station train-stop margin, the follow-on train new departure delay, the follow-on train new arrival delay and one decision-making attribute: the train sequence. It elaborates the extracting process of the decision-making rules in the train traffic control based on the rough set theory. It proposes an appraisal system which is suitable to the train traffic control and proves the application feasibility of the rough set theory in the railroad.

AB  - It is very important to get the frequent item set in the associate rule mining. In order to fast obtain the frequent item set from a database that includes multiple values, the definition of transaction database was extended. By the tree concept, a special tree was built in which every node is formed by item and item's count. On the foundation of apriori algorithm and artificial intelligent search, FABCTA (fast algorithm by candidate transaction tree and apriori) was presented to solve the frequent item set in small branches of tree. By the test on real data, FABCTA is more efficient than apriori algorithm.

AB  - Characterization of the population in evolutionary algorithms using graphical models is of advantage to express the whole construction and inherent relations of genetic information. The technique of speedy and effective to creation of a graph and its metric is the key of success to integrate these graphical models into an evolutionary algorithm. Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs, and they are one of the important graphical models. To analyze the structure of Bayesian networks based on evolutionary algorithm, some definitions with the property of the Bayesian networks metric were introduced. For any two gene locations a and b of chromosomes (that is, any two isolated vertices of Bayesian networks), the paper analyzed the metric relationship among three graphs containing an edge from a to b, from b to a and with no edge. At the same time the efficient approach to study the structure of population on evolutionary algorithm was also put forward.

AB  - Model-Based diagnosis is an active branch of Artificial Intelligent. The method is a NP-Hard problem, resolving minimal hitting sets from minimal conflict sets. A compounded genetic and simulated annealing algorithm is put forward by mapping hitting sets problem to 0/1 integer programming problem. After providing the genetic simulated annealing (GSA) algorithm, the efficiency and accuracy of GSA algorithm is tested and compared. The GSA algorithm is not only far more efficient than the traditional one, but also can save 1/3 to 1/2 time than the GA algorithm when the number of conflict sets is more than 35. It can get 98% to 100% minimal diagnosis in most conditions.

AB  - Image segmentation plays a crucial role in many medical imaging applications. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for fuzzy segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The algorithm is realized by modifying the objective function in the conventional fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm using a kernel-induced distance metric and a spatial penalty on the membership functions. Firstly, the original Euclidean distance in the FCM is replaced by a kernel-induced distance, and thus the corresponding algorithm is derived and called as the kernelized fuzzy C-means (KFCM) algorithm, which is shown to be more robust than FCM. Then a spatial penalty is added to the objective function in KFCM to compensate for the intensity inhomogeneities of MR image and to allow the labeling of a pixel to be influenced by its neighbors in the image. The penalty term acts as a regularizer and has a coefficient ranging from zero to one. Experimental results on both synthetic and real MR images show that the proposed algorithms have better performance when noise and other artifacts are present than the standard algorithms. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A new neural network based methods for solving the problem of congestion control arising at the user network interface (UNI) of ATM networks is proposed in this paper. Unlike the previous methods where the coding rate for all traffic sources as controller output signals is tuned in a body, the proposed method adjusts the coding rate for only a part of the traffic sources while the remainder sources send the cells in the previous coding rate in case of occurrence of congestion. The controller output signals include the source coding rate and the percentage of the sources that send cells at the corresponding coding rate. The control methods not only minimize the cell loss rate but also guarantee the quality of information (such as voice sources) fed into the multiplexer buffer. Simulations with 150 ADPCM voice sources fed into the multiplexer buffer showed that the proposed methods had advantage over the previous methods in the aspect of the performance indices such as cell loss rate (CLR) and voice quality.

AB  - To solve the problem of combination explosion during the disassembly sequence generation process, an approach based on the Hierarchy Network Graph to generate the disassembly sequence was put forward. By creating the Hierarchy Network Graph, product was divided into many disassembly parts, and they were described as Cell Network, which were put at the different levels of the Hierarchy Network Graph. By reorganizing the nodes of the graph, the Cell Network, whose node amount was more than the amount to be asked by the arithmetic of disassembly sequence generation, were rearranged as several new disassembly parts. Based on analyzing the precedence constraints related to the recombining graph, the generating arithmetic of the disassembly sequence was described, and in the arithmetic, the combination explosion can be avoided. At last, a case study was given to show that the method was applicable and effective.

AB  - Collaborative commerce systems in enterprises can be regarded as a set of business entities with correlative interests when considering the business rules, competition, restriction and cooperation among enterprises. A suitable modeling method for collaborative commerce chain was proposed based on intelligent agent model. The collaborative commerce entities were constructed through programming collaborative objects, seeking companions and selecting optimal cooperation scheme. The coordinated commerce desirability was made by maximizing the interests of collaborators. The coordinated commerce solution was obtained via Object Relation Diagram, process and directional ring. The application of the model to automobile industry shows its practicability through the increased efficiency in the coordinated interactions of enterprises, such as coordinated stocking, coordinated selling, coordinated manufacturing and coordinated configuring.

AB  - Coalition formation has been an active area of research that has attracted both theoretical and practical researchers in the areas of economics, distributed artificial intelligence (DAI), computer systems and some other industrial applications. As an effective mechanism, it has an emergent characteristic of being suitable for solving cooperation problems in both complex and dynamic environments. While task planning of agile manufacturing cell (AMC) is to dynamically allocate tasks on the level of manufacturing cells, where two types of coalitions are formed. In view of the linkage between them, the idea of coalition formation is applied in the planning of AMC. In this paper, a framework of AMC planning is presented, based on which, a planning method of AMC by searching for coalition structure is introduced in detail. In addition, a case study is carried out.

AB  - The balance between exploration and exploitation is one of the key problems of action selection in Q-learning. Pure exploitation causes the agent to reach the locally optimal policies quickly, whereas excessive exploration degrades the performance of the Q-learning algorithm even if it may accelerate the learning process and allow avoiding the locally optimal policies. In this paper, finding the optimum policy in Q-learning is described as search for the optimum solution in combinatorial optimization. The Metropolis criterion of simulated annealing algorithm is introduced in order to balance exploration and exploitation of Q-learning, and the modified Q-learning algorithm based on this criterion, SA-Q-learning, is presented. Experiments show that SA-Q-learning converges more quickly than Q-learning or Boltzmann exploration, and that the search does not suffer of performance degradation due to excessive exploration. © 2004 IEEE.

AB  - Fuzzy pattern recognition has been wildly used in pattern recognition due to its advantages, based on fuzzy sets theory, fuzzy pattern recognition has its limits: Fuzzy membership function is a single value which combines the evidence for and against the pattern without indicating how much there is of which, hence it cannot get the more objective result of recognition. Vague set is characterized by a truth-membership function and a false-membership function which can solve the problem. In this paper, the author proposed a new method for pattern recognition: Vague pattern recognition. This new method can characterize both the favoring evidence and the opposing evidence for every pattern and therefore can get a better result for recognition. Its application is also presented in this paper.

AB  - Finite element simulation, analytical calculation and artificial neural network are applied to predict the flanging formability of a V-shaped sheet metal part. A finite element model is established to study the influence of technical parameters on formability. Then an analytical model for axisymmetric case is developed based on the total strain theory and membrane assumption. Its applicability is shown through comparison with finite element results. A BP neural network for flanging of V-shaped sheet metal part is established through training finite element results. It is shown from the study that technical parameters, especially the flange angle, exert obvious influence on flanging operation; analytical model is more convenient, but only applicable to the cases with small flange angle and flange height; the BP neural network model based on finite element simulation and artificial intelligence technology can quickly and effectively predict the flanging formability.

AB  - A newly developed artificial immune algorithm was proposed and employed to optimize the dynamic zoning for vertical elevator traffic, thus implementing the optimization calculation of the elevator traffic for non-continuous floors. In this paper, the dynamic zoning model of elevator traffic was clearly outlined, and the artificial immune algorithm for the dynamic zoning model was designed. It was then simulated by comparison among different distributions of elevator traffic flow. The simulation results demonstrate that the dynamic zoning based on AIS is of excellent performance in handling uneven real-time up-peak traffic flow. The proposed algorithm can be utilized to rapidly search the optimal or sub-optimal zoning of elevator traffic and is of considerable practical value.

AB  - The problems of environment geotechnical damage and the prediction and control of the deformations during construction by using artificial intelligent method are discussed. Such soil damage and unallowable deformations are often happened under engineering construction in urban down-town areas due to construction disturbance. The factors of soil disturbance owing to various changes, as stress behavior, stress path under unloading condition in excavation, soil-void ratio, moisture content, as well as the failure of soil structures, change of soil chemical compositions, the mixture and separation of soil components, soil consolidation state, and so forth, are systematically studied. Furthermore, influence of construction disturbance as the changes of soil engineering properties above-mentioned on the soil strength, deformation, stability and bearing capacity during construction are studied theoretically and by lab-tests: sets of special experimental studies are conducted. In the other respect, for the first time soft science theory and techniques of artificial intelligence prediction and automatic control are introduced into the geotechnical field. A so-called multi-step circulation model of artificial neural network (ANN) method applied to predicting and forecasting the ground settlement in shield tunneling has been built, and a method of fuzzy-logic control has been used to realize the real-time and active control of deformation and displacement in construction works.

AB  - Taking into consideration the complex nonlinear relationship between faults and symptoms, we propose a structure model for diagnosis. We use fuzzy-neural network to learn the matrixes for diagnosis from the statistics of previous diagnostic instances, use fuzzy transform method to ratiocinate and use dynamic weight synthesis to integrate all ratiocinative results to get the diagnostic result. One of the important problems we discuss in detail is that one fault has many symptoms and one symptom may correspond to different faults, thus making the formulation of rules of diagnosis through learning difficult. Our detailed discussion and explanation reduce greatly the difficulty of such formulation of diagnostic rules. Thus, the acquisition and modification of rule will be much easier. The diagnosis process for an actual example of Airbus-320 is simulated. The simulation results show that the method is feasible and effective.

AB  - Artificial life enhances the reality and vitality of computer animation. To control the process of animation and instruct the action of characters in animation, artificial intelligence is introduced in computer animation. Cognitive models based on self-reproduction are presented and built to improve the cognition of artificial fish, and high-level motion controls based on animal logic are implemented. Deterministic behavior models on copulation, spawning and environmental selection of artificial fish are built. It is shown by experiments that a high-level motion controller makes artificial fish adapt the virtual environment of sea and complete the process of life such as copulation, spawning, etc.

AB  - To overcome the drawbacks of the conventional artificial potential fields in motion planning of mobile robots for dynamic uncertain environments, an artificial coordinating field (ACF) is proposed. Definitions and basic designs of the ACFs were investigated with regard to the collision risk and motion constraints of mobile robots. Based on the ACFs, an effective algorithm without the dead-lock for coordinating collision avoidance of multiple mobile robots in dynamic uncertain environments was developed. The theoretical analysis and simulations illustrated our results.

AB  - Until today, studies on the NOx generation mechanism in a boiler of pulverized-coal power station mainly concentrate on experiments and CFD model on chemical kinetics, but little on artificial neural networks. A few researchers only adopt characteristic of ANN black box without making good use of NOx generation mechanism. This paper presents an ANN model of NOx emissions on this mechanism. The model possesses many advantages such as predicting NOx emissions of each primary air and pulverized coal unite, NOx emissions of boiler, few hidden nodes, strong generalization, good robust and fast learning. The model presented can provide reference for huge power station boiler to reduce NOx emissions by auto-adjustment or reconstruction.

AB  - A new method, i.e., frequency mixing technique, was proposed to extract ultra-high-frequency (UHF) PD signals in this paper. By using this method, simulation studies were made to process UHF PD signals. Results showed that this method not only kept the peak value and phase characteristics, but also reduced the frequency of UHF PD signals. Based on frequency mixing technique, an on-line UHF PD monitoring system was developed for transformers. With this system, some typical PD models were detected. Experimental results showed that the technique can effectively detect the time and the amplitude of the high-frequency (adjustable center frequency between 400-800 MHz in minimum steps of 5 MHz) and narrowband (10, 20, 40 or 80 MHz) signals emitted from PD, calculate accurately phase resolved PD patterns and statistical operators, suppress effectively interference from background, and be useful for on-line monitoring and intelligent diagnosis of UHF PD in transformers.

AB  - Current neural network ensemble methods usually generate accurate and diverse component networks by disturbing the training data, and therefore achieve strong generalization ability. Causal discovery is employed to discover the ancestor attributes of the class attribute on the results of the sampling process. Then, component neural networks are trained on the samples with only the ancestor attributes being used as inputs. Thus, the mechanism of disturbing the training data and the input attribute is combined to help generate accurate and diverse component networks. Experiments show that the generalization ability of the proposed method is better than or comparable to that of the ensembles generated by some prevailing methods.

AB  - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) based on swarm intelligence is a new evolutionary computational tool and is successfully applied in function optimization, neural network design, classification, pattern recognition, signal processing and robot technology and so on, but the reports on its practical applications in power system are seldom seen. Here, the main research results of applying PSO in following aspects relevant to power system, such as distribution system expansion planning, generator maintenance scheduling, unit commitment, load economic dispatch, optimal power flow calculation and optimal control of reactive power, harmonic analysis and capacitor configuration, distribution state estimation, parameter identification and optimal design, are overall presented in detail. Along with the thorough study of PSO, its great latent capacity will be brought into play in the electricity market auction, bidding strategy and electricity market simulation.

AB  - Hidden space support vector machines (HSSVMs) are presented in this paper. The input patterns are mapped into a high-dimensional hidden space by a set of hidden nonlinear functions and then the structural risk is introduced into the hidden space to construct HSSVMs. Moreover, the conditions for the nonlinear kernel function in HSSVMs are more relaxed, and even differentiability is not required. Compared with support vector machines (SVMs), HSSVMs can adopt more kinds of kernel functions because the positive definite property of the kernel function is not a necessary condition. The performance of HSSVMs for pattern recognition and regression estimation is also analyzed. Experiments on artificial and real-world domains confirm the feasibility and the validity of our algorithms. © 2004 IEEE.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel cross-correlation neural network (CNN) model for finding the principal singular subspace of a cross-correlation matrix between two high-dimensional data streams. We introduce a novel nonquadratic criterion (NQC) for searching the optimum weights of two linear neural networks (LNN). The NQC exhibits a single global minimum attained if and only if the weight matrices of the left and right neural networks span the left and right principal singular subspace of a cross-correlation matrix, respectively. The other stationary points of the NQC are (unstable) saddle points. We develop an adaptive algorithm based on the NQC for tracking the principal singular subspace of a cross-correlation matrix between two high-dimensional vector sequences. The NQC algorithm provides a fast online learning of the optimum weights for two LNN. The global asymptotic stability of the NQC algorithm is analyzed. The NQC algorithm has several key advantages such as faster convergence, which is illustrated through simulations. © 2004 IEEE.

AB  - Powerful and flexible configuration model and highly effective configuration solution method are foundations of complex product configuration. To construct the complex product configuration model, a method of product configuration modeling based on Conditional Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CondCSP) paradigm was put forward. This method uniformly applied configuration variables and configuration constraints to express configuration model, which included product model and customer requirement. Configuration variable included type variable, property variable, port variable and cardinality variable. Configuration constraint included dependency constraint and activity constraint. Based on the uniform configuration model, a solution called model-decomposition method was put forward to provide solution to the configuration model. Finally an automobile product was used as an example to show how to construct and solve the configuration model.

AB  - Some problems on hydraulic characteristic of a low-specific speed centrifugal pump may affect its optimum design. To conciliate their conflicts and achieve the optimal combination of various parameters, some experts have accumulated abundant experiences in their practical works. We adopted these experiences in optimum design of a low-specific speed centrifugal pump based on the artificial intelligence theory and the expert system. The mathematical model of this expert system was also established.

AB  - Since the completeness of concept lattice, the time complexity of building concept lattice is a factor restricting the application of formal concept analysis. Based on the horizontal and vertical combination in formal contexts, this paper defines the independent or consistent contexts and lattices in attribute field; and also defines the horizontal addition operation between contexts or concepts and the horizontal union operation between concept lattices. In addition, we prove that the concept lattice of subcontexts horizontally combined is isomorphic to the horizontal union of sublattices of these subcontexts. Using the inherent general-special relation between concepts in sublatrice, the horizontal union algorithm of multiple concept lattices to construct the concept lattice is also presented. Experimental results show that the time complexity of this algorithm is much better than that of other construction algorithm of concept lattice from whole formal context. Evidently, our algorithm is very suitable for constructing concept lattice in parallel and distributed system.

AB  - Based on the clonal selection theory in the natural immune system, a novel artificial intelligent algorithm, Immune Monoclonal Strategy Algorithm (IMSA) is proposed. By simulating the mechanisms such as self-adjusting, learning and adaptation in the natural immune system, the algorithm realizes the global optimal computation as well as the local searching. According to antibody-antigen affinity, the algorithm can adjust adaptively the clonal scale of antibody population. It is proved theoretically that the IMSA is convergent with probability 1, and it is shown that IMSA has the strong abilities in having high convergence speed, enhancing the diversity of the population and avoiding the premature convergence to some degree, with the computer simulations to 4 benchmark functions.

AB  - One of the interferences between inheritance and concurrency is inheritance anomaly. From the view of cognitive computational neuroscience, a direct information representation method is presented based on neural system dynamics and graphic theory. A group of neurons and their connections representing perceptual information directly and the dynamical behaviors of neurons are defined firstly, and then a two-layer neural network is designed to record characteristics of stimulus and connect a specialized neural circuit that responding to the perception of that stimulus respectively. This could be achieved by the structure learning algorithm. The circuit constituted by neurons in two layers is also served as an associative memory of stimulus whose credibility is decided by the degree of connection of the circuit. The direct representation method is of very significance to the research of semantic representation and inference driven by semantics in artificial intelligence.

AB  - Uncertainty exists widely in the subjective and objective world. In all kinds of uncertainty, randomness and fuzziness are the most important and fundamental. The relationship between randomness and fuzziness is discussed. Uncertain states and their changes can be measured by entropy and hyper-entropy respectively. Taken advantage of entropy and hyper-entropy, the uncertainty of chaos, fractal and complex networks by their various evolution and differentiation are further studied. A simple and effective way is proposed to simulate the uncertainty by means of knowledge representation which provides a basis for the automation of both logic and image thinking with uncertainty. The AI (artificial intelligence) with uncertainty is a new cross-discipline, which covers computer science, physics, mathematics, brain science, psychology, cognitive science, biology and philosophy, and results in the automation of representation, process and thinking for uncertain information and knowledge.

AB  - The MIPS (model checking integrated planning system) has shown distinguished performance in the second and the third international planning competitions. In this paper, a declarative approach to adding domain knowledge in MIPS is presented. And DCIPS (domain constraints integrated planning system) has been developed according to this method. DCIPS allows different types of domain control knowledge such as objective, procedural or temporal knowledge to be represented and exploited in parallel, thus combining the ideas of planning = actions + states into domain control knowledge. An advantage of this approach is that the domain control knowledge can be modularly formalized and added to the planning problem as desired. DCIPS is experimentally verified on the three examples in the transportation domain from AIPS 2002 planning competition where it leads to significant speed-ups.

AB  - A model for distribution maintenance scheduling which intends to find the most economical maintenance schedule without violating any restrictions is proposed. To solve this complicate problem, this paper presents a hybrid strategy that sufficiently combines the advantages of Immune Algorithm (IA) and Tabu Search (TS). By constructing three effective bacterins which derive from the features of distribution maintenance schedule and introducing TS into mutation operation of IA in the earlier generations, the hybrid strategy improves the convergence of optimization and shortens the calculation time. The proposed model and method are applied to a practical system, and numerical results verify the correctness and validity of them.

AB  - World Wide Web (WWW) is a vast repository of information, including a great deal of geographic information. But the location and retrieval of geographic information will require a significant amount of time and effort. In addition, different users usually have different views and interests in the same information. To resolve such problems, this paper first proposed a model of geographic information gathering based on multi-Agent (MA) architecture. Then based on this model, we construct a prototype system with GML (Geography Markup Language). This system consists of three tiers-Client, Web Server and Data Resource. Finally, we expatiate on the process of Web Server.

AB  - How to share experience and resources among learners is becoming one of the hottest topics in the field of E-Learning collaborative techniques. An intuitive way to achieve this objective is to group learners which can help each other into the same community and help them learn collaboratively. In this paper, we proposed a novel community self-organization model based on multi-agent mechanism, which can automatically group learners with similar preferences and capabilities. In particular, we proposed award and exchange schemas with evaluation and preference track records to raise the performance of this algorithm. The description of learner capability, the matchmaking process, the definition of evaluation and preference track records, the rules of award and exchange schemas and the self-organization algorithm are all discussed in this paper. Meanwhile, a prototype has been built to verify the validity and efficiency of the algorithm. Experiments based on real learner data showed that this mechanism can organize learner communities properly and efficiently; and that it has sustainable improved efficiency and scalability.

AB  - The density-based clustering algorithm presented is different from the classical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) (Ester et al., 1996), and has the following advantages: first, Greedy algorithm substitutes for R*-tree (Bechmann et al., 1990) in DBSCAN to index the clustering space so that the clustering time cost is decreased to great extent and I/O memory load is reduced as well; second, the merging condition to approach to arbitrary-shaped clusters is designed carefully so that a single threshold can distinguish correctly all clusters in a large spatial dataset though some density-skewed clusters live in it. Finally, authors investigate a robotic navigation and test two artificial datasets by the proposed algorithm to verify its effectiveness and efficiency.

AB  - For a surface mounting machine (SMM) in printed circuit board (PCB) assembly line, there are four problems, e.g. CAD data conversion, nozzle selection, feeder assignment and placement sequence determination. A hierarchical planning for them to maximize the throughput rate of an SMM is presented here. To minimize set-up time, a CAD data conversion system was first applied that could automatically generate the data for machine placement from CAD design data files. Then an effective nozzle selection approach was implemented to minimize the time of nozzle changing. And then, to minimize picking time, an algorithm for feeder assignment was used to make picking multiple components simultaneously as much as possible. Finally, in order to shorten pick-and-place time, a heuristic algorithm was used to determine optimal component placement sequence according to the decided feeder positions. Experiments were conducted on a four head SMM. The experimental results were used to analyse the assembly line performance.

AB  - This paper proposes a Genetic Programming-Based Modeling (GPM) algorithm on chaotic time series. GP is used here to search for appropriate model structures in function space, and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used for Nonlinear Parameter Estimation (NPE) of dynamic model structures. In addition, GPM integrates the results of Nonlinear Time Series Analysis (NTSA) to adjust the parameters and takes them as the criteria of established models. Experiments showed the effectiveness of such improvements on chaotic time series modeling.

AB  - A new framework for consciousness is introduced based upon traditional artificial neural network models. This framework reflects explicit connections between two parts of the brain: one global working memory and distributed modular cerebral networks relating to specific brain functions. Accordingly this framework is composed of three layers, physical mnemonic layer and abstract thinking layer, which cooperate together through a recognition layer to accomplish information storage and cognition using algorithms of how these interactions contribute to consciousness: (1) the reception process whereby cerebral subsystems group distributed signals into coherent object patterns; (2) the partial recognition process whereby patterns from particular subsystems are compared or stored as knowledge; and (3) the resonant learning process whereby global workspace stably adjusts its structure to adapt to patterns' changes. Using this framework, various sorts of human actions can be explained, leading to a general approach for analyzing brain functions.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology for off-line handwritten Chinese character recognition based on mergence of consecutive segments of adaptive duration. The handwritten Chinese character string is partitioned into a sequence of consecutive segments, which are combined to implement dissimilarity evaluation within a sliding window whose durations are determined adaptively by the integration of shapes and context of evaluations. The average stroke width is estimated for the handwritten Chinese character string, and a set of candidate character segmentation boundaries is found by using the integration of pixel and stroke features. The final decisions on segmentation and recognition are made under minimal arithmetical mean dissimilarities. Experiments proved that the proposed approach of adaptive duration outperforms the method of fixed duration, and is very effective for the recognition of overlapped, broken, touched, loosely configured Chinese characters.

AB  - Support vector machine (SVM), as a novel type of learning machine, for the first time, was used to develop a predictive model for early diagnosis of anorexia. It was based on the concentration of six elements (Zn, Fe, Mg, Cu, Ca, and Mn) and the age extracted from 90 cases. Compared with the results obtained from two other classifiers, partial least squares (PLS) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN), the SVM method exhibited the best whole performance. The accuracies for the test set by PLS, BPNN, and SVM methods were 52%, 65%, and 87%, respectively. Moreover, the models we proposed could also provide some insight into what factors were related to anorexia.

AB  - A new method support vector machine (SVM) and the heuristic method (HM) were used to develop the nonlinear and linear models between the capacity factor (logk) and seven molecular descriptors of 75 peptides for the first time. The molecular descriptors representing the structural features of the compounds only included the constitutional and topological descriptors, which can be obtained easily without optimizing the structure of the molecule. The seven molecular descriptors selected by the heuristic method in CODESSA were used as inputs for SVM. The results obtained by SVM were compared with those obtained by the heuristic method. The prediction result of the SVM model is better than that of heuristic method. For the test set, a predictive correlation coefficient R = 0.9801 and root-mean-square error of 0.1523 were obtained. The prediction results are in very good agreement with the experimental values. But the linear model of the heuristic method is easier to understand and ready to use for a chemist. This paper provided a new and effective method for predicting the chromatography retention of peptides and some insight into the structural features which are related to the capacity factor of peptides.

AB  - There are direct relations between object completion and the opponents' intention recognition for multi-robot systems under dynamic and oppositional environments. However, current methods cannot determine the opponents' intentions in a rapid and effective way. A novel method of opponents' intention recognition and countermeasure based on their behaviors is proposed for multi-robot systems. First, the structure of intention recognition and countermeasure are briefly introduced. Then, the model of opponents' behavior, model of opponents' behavior rules and set of countermeasure are constructed. Three means including environment restriction, criticality and aftereffect probability are applied to sort multi possible intentions and determine the real one. Finally, the new results are given to illustrate the availability of the proposed method.

AB  - A robot soccer strategy based on vague sets and fuzzy logic is proposed. First, the characteristic factors are selected and Vague sets related to the given factor are constructed. Then, decision-making values reflecting the offense and defense positional states in the analysis of the situation are calculated and formations are selected according to decision-making values and formation selection algorithm. Finally, each role related to special formation is assigned. The robots' roles are not fixed. They can dynamically exchange their roles according to formation. The strategy enables robots to cooperate and coordinate with each other to achieve the objectives of offense and defense. The strategy considers all factors, and sets up simple model, and makes quick timely decision.

AB  - Based on distributed artificial intelligence, the paper put forward MAS based distributed intelligent malfunction diagnosis method and process, and discussed pattern-clustering based malfunction solution-finding mechanism and the identification and decomposing of a diagnosis task. It also studied the restriction and relationship of multi-agent in the macroscopic sense, and designed the expression mechanism for applied agent's work status. Else it ascertained the influence and the communication and the interaction among applied agents, and constructed a multi-agent fuzzy related model. The last aspect is that the paper presented an integrated descriptive structure of local diagnosis decision and global diagnosis decision, and established a distributed agent diagnosis system structure and its prototype model system too. Diagnosis system can be divided into applied agent and service agent, using distributed communication mechanism to realize intercommunication of information, realize distributed system's information exchange and diagnosis, and enhance system's efficiency, security and error-standing for problem-dealing. When the model was applied in the power enterprise's security monitor system the result was similar to expert system, and the model overcame many deficiencies of previous monitor diagnosis system, enhanced the efficiency of the enterprise security running.

AB  - In the process of data mining of decision table using Rough Sets methodology, the main computational effort is associated with the determination of the reducts. Computing all reducts is a combinatorial NP-hard computational problem. Therefore the only way to achieve its faster execution is by providing an algorithm, with a better constant factor, which may solve this problem in reasonable time for real-life data sets. The purpose of this presentation is to propose two new efficient algorithms to compute reducts in information systems. The proposed algorithms are based on the proposition of reduct and the relation between the reduct and discernibility matrix. Experiments have been conducted on some real world domains in execution time. The results show it improves the execution time when compared with the other methods. In real application, we can combine the two proposed algorithms. Copyright © 2004 JSAI.

AB  - Knowledge acquisition has become the bottleneck of intelligent diagnosis. To deal with that problem, data mining technology is applied to fault diagnosis for equipment to find the potential value of the historical monitoring data. On the basis of correlation between time-series data, similarity search is used to increase efficiency of pattern discovery. The advanced technologies in artificial intelligence, computational intelligence (artificial neural network, genetic algorithm) and pattern recognition are combined to diagnose fault. The data mining system based on similarity search is discussed and applied to a new kind of knowledge acquisition method in mechanical fault diagnosis based on large historical monitoring data. In this system, efficiency and deepness of data analysis are promoted, and an advanced method for intelligent diagnosis, especially for fault forecast is provided.

AB  - In the immunized neural network identification (INNI), the changeable neuro-system model (CNS), which is used to compensate the disturbance of system, is established by choosing building blocks chosen with the genetic algorithm (GA). When the number and category of the building blocks are great, the search space dimension of CNS is very high, and its search time is long. One of effective approaches to shorten search time is to reduce the dimension of search space. In immune system, the antibodies against certain antigens is searched under the ground of antibody recognization ball (RB). Because RB offers approximate antibodies at the beginning of antibody searching process, many useful genes need not search. In this way the search space dimension of antibody is reduced drastically, and the search speed of antibody is very fast. With regard to this mechanism, an approach of reducing search space dimension is proposed based on artificial immune system (AIS): A kind of new AIS-antibody recognization ball network (ARBN) is constructed, and its training algorithm is presented. The ARBN is used to generalize, memorize the characteristics of building block combinations and create the effective initial group of GA. Simulation results show that with this approach the searching speed of CNS can be quickened effectively.

AB  - Modern malfunction diagnosis is a dynamic, distributed, flexible, real-time and uncertain complicated system. The paper tried to introduce multi-agent technology to the complicated malfunction diagnosis. Based on the distributed artificial intelligence, the paper analyzed multi-agent system (MAS) based on the distributed intelligent malfunction diagnosis method and process, and discussed pattern-clustering based malfunction solution-finding mechanism and the identification and decomposing of a diagnosis task. It also studied the restriction and relationship of multi-agent in the sense of macroscopic, and designed the expression mechanism for applied agent's work status. Else it ascertained the influence and the communication and the interaction among applied agents, constructed a multi-agent fuzzy related model. The paper presented an integrated descriptive structure of local diagnosis decision and global diagnosis decision, established a distributed agent diagnosis system structure and its prototype model system too. When the model was applied to the power enterprise's security monitor system, the result was similar to expert system. The model overcame many deficiencies of precious monitor diagnosis system, enhanced the efficiency of the enterprise security running. Compared with the traditional diagnosis method, the proposed model has the special advantage in the distributed domain.

AB  - Successful information integration of enterprises lies in dynamic organization and generation of relevant knowledge nodes in information chain-group, and the collaborative workflow of these nodes, which were established in the chain-group network. A knowledge node was a fundamental node in collaboration and integration network system of the enterprise's production information. When the production information network began to be constructed, a knowledge node might be able to call appropriate knowledge node as node unit to constitute production workflow chain according to its own collaboration requirements, or it might adjust a certain knowledge node according to market change. A knowledge node was made up of several intelligent cells (or intelligent cell class). The intelligent cell was the basic unit of the knowledge node, and it was the pattern description and information processing of a specific semi-finished product task during the production process.

AB  - Internet multi-robotics is a typical discrete-event system. In order to describe joint activities between multiple operators and multiple robots, a 4-level discrete-event model is proposed in this paper based on the controlled condition/event Petri nets (CCEP). On the first or mission level, the task splitting of the system is defined; on the second or multi-operator level, a precedence graph is introduced for every operator to plan his or her robotic actions; on the third or coordination level, the above precedence graphs are translated and integrated into the corresponding CCEPs in terms of specific rules; and on the last or multi-robot level, operators can select their control range by setting the corresponding control marks of the obtained CCEPs. As a consequence, a clear mechanism of operator-robot collaboration is obtained to conduct the development of the system.

AB  - To improve the prediction accuracy of model represented by artificial neural networks (ANN) ensemble, a new approach for constructing neural network ensemble was proposed. The basic idea of this novel approach was to optimally construct neural network ensemble with the aid of particle swarm optimizations (PSO). After a number of neural networks (NN) were properly trained, all possible NN ensembles were represented by particles in a multi-dimensional space, in which each dimension represented a particular NN, and the value 0 or 1 for each dimension meant whether or not the corresponding NN was to be included in the ensemble. Then discrete PSO algorithm was used to optimally select the ensembles. The results of the selection caused the optimized ensemble to include individual NN members with higher diversity. The prediction error of the model expressed by ensemble was determined by the degree of correlation between NN components, which was also used as the fitness function. Empirical studies on regression upon eight typical data sets show that this approach yields ensemble with significantly smaller size, while achieving much better performance than other traditional ones such as Bagging method.

AB  - Based on principal component analysis, the rules of clayey soil's behaviors affected by varied indices were studied. It was discovered that the common method of the single liquidity index IL used to determine the consistency of silt-clay or silt-loam was not rational. It was more rational that the liquidity index IL combined with the void ratio e characterized the behavior of silt-clay. Similarly the index of e depicted the nature of sandy loam more rationally than IL. The method of predicting the pile shafted resistance by the two indices of e and IL, which was more accurate, was obtained by the methodology of back propagation (BP) artificial neural networks combined with principal component analysis. It was also observed that the pile shaft resistance increased with the increase of depth within a critical affect-depth ranging from 20 to 30 m, and the harder the clayey soil consistency was, the shallower the critical depth was.

AB  - Conditional Effects is the most difficult one in dealing with more expressive action description language in AI planning. It becomes one of the AI planning research's hotspots, how to expand the existing planning algorithm to handle the action describe language with conditional effects. This paper improves FF v2.3, which is one of the most efficient planners, in handling conditional effects, and brings forward a new approach of handling conditional effects, named CEFF (Conditional Effects FF). Two main improvements of CEFF are as following; (1) adopting the soul of factor expansion, CEFF increases the efficiency of handling CE. (2) in the expanding planning graph phase, CEFF introduces the judgment of exclusive relation, and avoids the great mass of dead-end states. Therefore, CEFF is more practical than FF v2.3.

AB  - This paper discusses using genetic algorithms (GA) to optimize the structure of radial basis probabilistic neural networks (RBPNN), including how to select hidden centers' of the first hidden layer and to determine the controlling parameter of Gaussian kernel functions. In the process of constructing the genetic algorithm, a novel encoding method is proposed for optimizing the RBPNN structure. This encoding method can not only make the selected hidden centers sufficiently reflect the key distribution characteristic in the space of training samples set and reduce the hidden centers number as few as possible, but also simultaneously determine the optimum controlling parameters of Gaussian kernel functions matching the selected hidden centers. Additionally, we also constructively propose a new fitness function so as to make the designed RBPNN as simple as possible in the network structure in the case of not losing the network performance. Finally, we take the two benchmark problems of discriminating two-spiral problem and classifying the iris data, for example, to test and evaluate this designed GA. The experimental results illustrate that our designed GA can significantly reduce the required hidden centers number, compared with the recursive orthogonal least square algorithm (ROLSA) and the modified K-means algorithm (MKA). In particular, by means of statistical experiments it was proved that the optimized RBPNN by our designed GA, have still a better generalization performance with respect to the ones by the ROLSA and the MKA, in spite of the network scale having been greatly reduced. Additionally, our experimental results also demonstrate that our designed GA is also suitable for optimizing the radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN).

AB  - The classifiction of heart beats is the foundation for automated arrhythmia monitoring devices. Support vector machnies (SVMs) have meant a great advance in solving classification or pattern recognition. This study describes SVM for the identification of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in surface ECGs. Features for the classification task are extracted by analyzing the heart rate, morphology and wavelet energy of the heart beats from a single lead. The performance of different SVMs is evaluated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database following the association for the advancement of medical instrumentation (AAMI) recommendations.

AB  - In this paper, a syntactic pattern recognition method of the detection of pulse wave's characteristic information is introduced. According to it, the pressure signal of pulse is measured by non-invasive diagnostic method. Then, the elementary abstracting system transfers it into an input pattern. The recognizer, constructed by Earley algorithm, recognizes the pulse wave's pattern. On the base of it, the pulse wave's characteristic information can be got.

AB  - Statistical iterative reconstruction algorithms have shown improved image quality over conventional nonstatistical methods in PET by using accurate system response models and measurement noise models. Strictly speaking, however, PET measurements, pre-corrected for accidental coincidences, are neither Poisson nor Gaussian distributed and thus do not meet basic assumptions of these algorithms. In addition, the difficulty in determining the proper system response model also greatly affects the quality of the reconstructed images. In this paper, we explore the usage of state space principles for the estimation of activity map in tomographic PET imaging. The proposed strategy formulates the organ activity distribution through tracer kinetics models, and the photon-counting measurements through observation equations, thus makes it possible to unify the dynamic reconstruction problem and static reconstruction problem into a general framework. Further, it coherently treats the uncertainties of the statistical model of the imaging system and the noisy nature of measurement data. Since H(infinity) filter seeks minimummaximum-error estimates without any assumptions on the system and data noise statistics, it is particular suited for PET image reconstruction where the statistical properties of measurement data and the system model are very complicated. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using Shepp-Logan simulated phantom data and real phantom data with favorable results.

AB  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an efficient novel method originated from the statistical learning theory. It is powerful in machine learning to solve problems with finite samples. Due to the deficiency of cancer cells, character of patient and noise in the raw data, it is very difficult to diagnose early cancer accurately. In this paper, SVM is employed in detecting early cancer and the results are encouraged compared with conventional methods. The accuracy of Non-linear SVM classifier is especially high in all kinds of classifiers, which indicates the potential application of SVM in early cancer detection.

AB  - With the development of biotechnology, especially the projects which lead to high throughout experimental results, lots of data have been jammed in every related fields, and broke the balance between data and knowledge in these fields. It is urgent to refine these data, and let them be more productive. To avoid these data being decaying into rubbish, technology and theory such as database, statistics, data mining, knowledge management, and artificial intelligence had been applied into biologic and medical study fields. So, a new standalone research subject--biomed-informatics has been formed. This paper reviewed the application of biomed-informatics in cardiovascular research, and gave the view for the future development of this subject.

AB  - In order to optimize the sintering process, a real-time operation guide system with artificial intelligence was developed, mainly including the data acquisition online subsystem, the sinter chemical composition controller, the sintering process state controller, and the abnormal conditions diagnosis subsystem. Knowledge base of the sintering process controlling was constructed, and inference engine of the system was established. Sinter chemical compositions were controlled by the strategies of self-adaptive prediction, internal optimization and center on basicity. And the state of sintering was stabilized centering on permeability. In order to meet the needs of process change and make the system clear, the system has learning ability and explanation function. The software of the system was developed in Visual C++ programming language. The application of the system shows that the hitting accuracy of sinter compositions and burning through point prediction are more than 85%; the first-grade rate of sinter chemical composition, stability rate of burning through point and stability rate of sintering process are increased by 3%, 9% and 4%, respectively.

AB  - A support vector machine with quadratic polynomial kernel function based nonlinear model multi-step-ahead optimizing predictive controller was presented. A support vector machine based predictive model was established by black-box identification. And a quadratic objective function with receding horizon was selected to obtain the controller output. By solving a nonlinear optimization problem with equality constraint of model output and boundary constraint of controller output using Nelder-Mead simplex direct search method, a sub-optimal control law was achieved in feature space. The effect of the controller was demonstrated on a recognized benchmark problem and a continuous-stirred tank reactor. The simulation results show that the multi-step-ahead predictive controller can be well applied to nonlinear system, with better performance in following reference trajectory and disturbance-rejection.

AB  - Studies on learning problems from geometry perspective have attracted an ever increasing attention in machine learning, leaded by achievements on information geometry. This paper proposes a different geometrical learning from the perspective of high-dimensional descriptive geometry. Geometrical properties of high-dimensional structures underlying a set of samples are learned via successive projections from the higher dimension to the lower dimension until two-dimensional Euclidean plane, under guidance of the established properties and theorems in high-dimensional descriptive geometry. Specifically, we introduce a hyper sausage like geometry shape for learning samples and provides a geometrical learning algorithm for specifying the hyper sausage shapes, which is then applied to biomimetic pattern recognition. Experimental results are presented to show that the proposed approach outperforms three types of support vector machines with either a three degree polynomial kernel or a radial basis function kernel, especially in the cases of high-dimensional samples of a finite size. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - SVMs(support vector machines) is a new artificial intelligence methodology derived from Vapnik's statistical learning theory, which has better generalization than artificial neural network. A C-support vector classifiers Based Fault Diagnostic Model (CBFDM) which gives the 3 most possible fault causes is constructed in this paper. Five fold cross validation is chosen as the method of model selection for CBFDM. The simulated data are generated from PW4000-94 engine influence coefficient matrix at cruise, and the results show that the diagnostic accuracy of CBFDM is over 93 % even when the standard deviation of noise is 3 times larger than the normal. This model can also be used for other diagnostic problems.

AB  - Most methods for fMRI data analysis assume that the hemodynamic responses (HRs) across similar experimental events are same. This assumption is not appropriate when HRs vary un-predictably from trial to trial. Here, we introduce a new method for fMRI data analysis. The main features of the proposed method are as follows: 1) The trial-to-trial variability is modeled as meaningful signal rather than assuming that the same HR is evoked in each trial; 2) Since the proposed method is a constrained optimization based general framework, it could be extended by utilizing prior knowledge of HR; 3) The traditional deconvolution method can be included into our method as a special case. A comparison of performance on simulated fMRI datasets is made using the general linear model, the deconvolution method and the proposed method with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology. In addition, we examined the effectiveness and usefulness of our method on real experimental data. © 2005, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To facilitate tissue engineering strategies determination with informatics tools. Methods: Firstly, tissue engineering experimental data were standardized and integrated into a centralized database; secondly, we used data mining tools (e.g. artificial neural nerworb and decision trees) to predict the outcomes of tissue engineering strategies; thirdly, a strategy design algorithm was developed, and its efficacy was validated with animal experiments; lastly, we constructed an online database and a decision support system for tissue engineering. Results: The artificial neural networks and the decision trees respectively predicted the outcomes of tissue engineering strategies with the predictive accuracy of 95.14% and 85.26%. Following the strategies generated by computer, we cured 18 of the 20 experimental animals with a significantly lower cost than usual. Conclusion: Informatics is beneficial for realizing safe, effective and economical tissue engineering. © 2005 Schattauer GmbH.

AB  - The current situation and progress of train operation adjustment were analyzed. The research focused on models and algorithms. The limitation of traditional solution model and algorithm research was analyzed. The research concept of integrating dynamically the existing models and algorithms was put forward. By adopting the dynamically integrated method based on multi-agent system, model objects and algorithm objects were transformed into multi-agent. The interactive strategy among multi-agent was defined, thus the dynamical integration of the adjustment method was realized. The solution based on multi-agent system for dynamically integrating train operation adjustment model and algorithm was presented.

AB  - Tissue engineers are often confused when seeking the most effective, economical and secure scheme for tissue engineering. The aim of this study is to generate tissue engineering schemes with artificial intelligence instead of human intelligence. The experimental data of tissue engineered cartilage were integrated and standardized with a centralized database, and a scheme engine was developed using artificial intelligent methods (artificial neural networks and decision trees). The scheme engine was trained with existing cases in the database, and then was used to generate tissue engineering schemes for new experimental animals. Following the schemes generated by the artificial intelligent system, we cured 18 of the 20 experimental animals. In conclusion, artificial intelligence is a powerful method for decision making in the tissue engineering realm. © Wichtig Editore, 2005.

AB  - The three subsystems composition theory for mechatronic systems and their interrelationships were analyzed. DPAM-F design model for generalized mechanism sub-system of mechatronic systems was studied. Utilizing the merits of artificial intelligence programming language SICStus Prolog, the DPAM-F design model was computerized. The essential software platform for intelligentized scheme generation of generalized mechanism was built. The practical application of this design model was illustrated through scheme generation and automatic simulation of thread-cutting mechanism in sewing machine, and the experiment arrives at a good result.

AB  - After the relationship of Universal-Special in basic shops was analyzed, the concept of Universal Shop scheduling Problem (USP), which included all basic shop scheduling problems, was put forward. A disjunctive graph model representing USP was established, and the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) used for USP was demonstrated. A case study assumed that a manufacturing system contained OSP, JSP and HFSP. When the system was treated as USP, the approximately optimal makespan computed by ACO was obviously better than the least makespan by enumerating all the possible solutions as the three shops were scheduled separately.

AB  - A new approach to the intelligent design was proposed by modeling the process of generating intuition. Firstly, a genetic representation was employed to define the design elements, including function and structure, etc. Then the Hopfield neural network was improved to implement the associative memory. The cognitive and computational models for intuition generation were established. Subsequently the environmental variable was introduced to extend the design space, and the crossover and mutation operators were used for the computational procedure of creative design. Finally, a case study of the creative design of table's style was given to demonstrate the proposed approach.

AB  - Artificial intelligence technology is applied in the precise and rapid battlefield damage assessment. The primary problem is to achieve knowledge in battlefield damage assessment and represent it with proper methods. On the basis of the structural tree of a gun and the damage data analyzed by damage modes and effect analysis, the paper set up the equipment system damage tree, on which correlative assessment knowledge is achieved. The knowledge is represented with the object-oriented method and organized with frames based on the damage tree model. A knowledge base is built up on this organization in which each kind of knowledge is packaged in a frame and all frames are independent. It can be maintained and extended easily, and the reasoning efficiency can be improved, so the requirements on assessment are satisfied. The effective reasoning strategy is finally set up.

AB  - A new heuristic density-based ant colony clustering algorithm (HDACC) is presented. The device of memory bank is first proposed, which brings forth the heuristic knowledge guiding ant to move in the bi-dimensional grid space. In this way, the algorithm's convergence is speeded up and the appearance of un-assigned data object avoided, and the error rate in classification drops subsequently. A density-based method is then proposed permitting each ant to look ahead and reduces the number of times in region-inquiry. Consequently the clustering time is saved. Some experiments were made on real and synthetic date sets. Experimental results were compared with those obtained using other classical clustering algorithms. The results demonstrated that the proposed HDBCSI is a viable and effective clustering algorithm.

AB  - A new nonlinear feature extraction method called kernel Foley-Sammon optimal discriminant vectors (KFSODVs) is presented in this paper. This new method extends the well-known Foley-Sammon optimal discriminant vectors (FSODVs) from linear domain to a nonlinear domain via the kernel trick that has been used in support vector machine (SVM) and other commonly used kernel-based learning algorithms. The proposed method also provides an effective technique to solve the so-called small sample size (SSS) problem which exists in many classification problems such as face recognition. We give the derivation of KFSODV and conduct experiments on both simulated and real data sets to confirm that the KFSODV method is superior to the previous commonly used kernel-based learning algorithms in terms of the performance of discrimination. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Complex pupil filters are introduced to improve the three-dimensional resolving power of an optical imaging stem. Through the design of the essential parameters of such filters, the transmittance and radius of the first zone, three-dimensional superresolution is realized. The Strehl ratio and the transverse and axial gains of such filters are analyzed in detail. A series of simulation examples of such filters are also presented that prove that three-dimensional superresolution can be realized. The advantage of such filters is that it is easy to realize three-dimensional superresolution, and the disadvantage is that the sidelobes of the axial intensity distribution are too high. But this can be overcome by the application of a confocal system. © 2005 Optical Society of America.

AB  - Based on the authors previous work of developing an expert system for fault diagnosis of chemical processes, this paper presents principles and approaches of the knowledge base maintenance in the expert system. Development and implementation of maintenance modules for the knowledge base in the expert system for fault diagnosis of fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) are reported in detail. Algorithms are proposed for integrality verification of five inconsistencies among heuristic rules: contradiction, redundancy, subsumption, circulation, and reclusion. The modules ensure the knowledge base and the expert system to work stably and efficiently. DELPHI and SQL SERVER are adopted in developing the modules. Application in FCCU fault diagnosis expert system shows that the modules work rationally and efficiently with user-friendly interface, besides its strong interactive feature and better performance of the expert system. The modules have been in continuous use in the expert system of fault diagnosis of FCCU installation in a refinery for the last two years. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper integrates an improved discrete binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO)with the standard PSO method for solving unit commitment (UC) problem with complicated constraints mixed-integer programming. The UC problem is decomposed into two embedded optimization subproblems: a unit on/off status schedule problem with integer variables that can be solved by the BPSO method and an economic dispatch problem with continuous that can be solved by the standard PSO method. At the same time the swap mutation operator based on the priority-ranked and repair strategy are introduced, which can be effectively dealt with the minimum up/down time constraints and enhance the algorithm's global optimal performance and computational efficiency. The feasibility and validity of the method is demonstrated for 10-unit system, and the test results are compared with those previously reported methods. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs better in terms of solution's precision and convergence property.

AB  - Based on the structural risk minimization principle, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, the best machine learning algorithm in the artificial intelligence field today, is introduced. Two kinds of kernel functions( linear and radial basis function) and two kinds of loss functions (ε-insensitive and quadratic) and different penalty parameter C are adopted to program a SVM routine in Matlab. Using the developed SVM model, many influencing factors of slope angle design are analyzed. With continued parameter modification and comparative calculations, a SVM network model with high accuracy of fitting was established. The reliability of this SVM network model is verified by sample testing, where many kinds of accuracy influencing factors of the SVM model are considered. The precision influencing sequence of these parameters is confirmed based on the calculation results, providing reference for similar engineering applications.

AB  - The columnar organization is a ubiquitous feature in the cerebral cortex. In this study, a neural network model simulating the cortical columns has been constructed. When fed with random pulse input with constant rate, a column generates synchronized oscillations, with a frequency varying from 3 to 43 Hz depending on parameter values. The behavior of the model under periodic stimulation was studied and the input-output relationship was non-linear. When identical columns were sparsely interconnected, the column oscillator could be locked in synchrony. In a network composed of heterogeneous columns, the columns were organized by intrinsic properties and formed partially synchronized assemblies. Copyright by Science in China Press 2005.

AB  - Originated from human immune system, artificial immune system has been widely applied in the computational fields, especially for the task of anomaly detection. Although intensively investigated in the literature, most of the artificial immune systems involve the process of model pre-definition according to the specific scenarios to be coped with. The pre-definition, however, could cause the system to be unreliable and inflexible. Instead, we propose in this paper an integrated artificial immune system platform, which can automatically adapt to various types of immune models. For a particular object to be detected, the platform is able to configure the model set dynamically based on the "pressure" produced during the course of training and testing. In addition, a hybrid evaluation of multi-AIS-models is employed in the integrated platform to improve the self-adaptability of the system.

AB  - Aimed at selecting the best approach for a damaged geological formation, an intellectual decision-making method based on a weighted fuzzy reasoning network is brought forward. This decision support model combines the excellence of fuzzy logic in that it can express domain rules and metempirical knowledge wholly by virtue of a neural network so that it can adapt to the environment automatically. It can also analyze qualitative and quantitative data at the same time. With sufficient geological data of damaged formation and history data of measure effects, this model can ascertain the decision-making factors which will affect treatment selections and take the increase of oil recovery and dependable crop time as its decision-making target. The methods of building and implementing this intellectual decision-making model are provided, and its viability is proved by the treatment result using practical data from an oil field.

AB  - Global path planning is an important research field of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Finding a collision-free path for an AUV from the source position to the destination position among fixed obstacles represents the intelligence level of an AUV to some extent. A global path planning method is proposed, using a genetic simulated annealing algorithm based on a hierarchical model to resolve the problem of path planning in an ocean. The algorithm has been implemented, and the results demonstrate its validity.

AB  - In our opinion, ant algorithm can help increase the efficiency of mission planning of a group of UAVs. Ant algorithm simulates the interactions among ants to coordinate and optimize their search for food. Similarly we can utilize ant algorithm to make interactions among UAVs more efficient in order to coordinate and optimize their missions for maximum destruction of enemy targets while minimizing the losses of the UAV group. The above is only a very brief and rather crude description of our idea, but in the full paper we explain in much detail how to optimize UAV mission planning with ant algorithm. Technically, our detailed explanation concerning UAV mission planning emphasizes two rules in the ant algorithm: (1) the rule of state change for ants' searching of optimal route to food targets; (2) the rule for the correction of Pheromone/Stigmergy. We give a numerical example. The numerical simulation results show preliminarily that, with ant algorithm, UAVs can choose the attack paths with the biggest ratio of value (destruction of enemy targets) to expense (losses of UAV group).

AB  - A new control method is proposed by using the gradual fuzzy neural network. In this method, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy neural network controller and gradual fuzzy control rules are adopted to stabilize the double-link inverted pendulum. Moreover, Genetic Algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller in 4 steps. Experimental results indicate that, only with 20 rules, the gradual fuzzy neural network controller can stabilize the double-link inverted pendulum with good effect and strong system robustness.

AB  - A Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) method, which was introduced to determine the manufacture time quota of injection mould, was put forward. As two key technologies of the method, case retrieval and case modification were focused. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of case retrieval, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based hierarchy retrieval model was proposed to optimize the feature weights. To improve the accuracy of case modification, a relative value and experience mixed modification strategy was put forward to combine and optimize the evaluation rules. Finally, an example was applied to verify the validity of the method.

AB  - Text information extraction is an important approach to processing large quantity of text. Maximum entropy provides a kind of framework for natural language processing. A new algorithm using hidden Markov model based on maximal entropy is proposed for text information extraction. The new algorithm combines the advantage of maximum entropy model, which can integrate and process rules and knowledge efficiently, with that of hidden Markov model, which has powerful technique foundations to solve sequence representation and statistical problem, and uses the sum of all features with weights to adjust the transition parameters in hidden Markov model for text information extraction. Experimental results show that the new algorithm improves the performance in precision and recall.

AB  - Fuzzy lattice based on finite L_context has limit on expansion and time and spatial complexity. Fuzzy-attributes concept lattice in common sense and cut calculation on it were defined to simplify lattice construction. A construction algorithm was presented. Two fuzzy parameters a and S on level of concept lattice node were defined to avoid extracting invalid association rules induced by high abbreviation. A case was given to demonstrate the principles for abstracting indefinite rules and computing their support and confidence. A comparison experiment between construction algorithm and Godin algorithm was made. The result shows that construction algorithm is superior to Godin algorithm on time-spatial complexity.

AB  - A process parameters design system of resistance spot welding of aluminum alloys integrating case based reasoning, fuzzy inference and fuzzy neural network (FNN) was developed. Material physical parameters such as electric conductivity and yield strength were used as inputs of the system. This is more suitable to the physical mechanism of resistance spot welding process. It showed more flexibility to design process by using process intensity as one of the parameters. A FNN was built to improve the intelligence of solution to process design and its learning ability. The results of numerical simulation of resistance spot welding aluminum alloys were included in database as a complementary for the FNN training. It enriched the training samples of FNN and intensified generalization ability of the system. The applications approved that the system was able to meet the practical demand of the process design.

AB  - The conflict between validity and extensibility can be solved by using a multi-side increase by degrees algorithm (shortened form MIDA) at machine learning in a data set with a feature space of high dimensionality and with large amount of samples that belong to many different classes. In the algorithm, the sample set is divided into several sample subsets step by step by double-point. These feature subsets to match each sample set can be extracted at the same time. The method of different treatment to each sample subset is similar to that facing difficult problems people consider and seek a answer from different emphases and multi sides. The algorithm can classify the difficult problems effectually, raise the extensibility and reduce the complexity in condition of established accuracy. The multi-side increase by degrees algorithm bases on a covering algorithm at machine learning. MIDA is used to classify a date set from Shanghai's stock, and the result is satisfied.

AB  - Prior logic program (PLP) are important for reasoning with priorities in commonsense reasoning. A new kind of argumentation framework for PLP with literal prior orders is introduced. The proposed framework incorporates the order processing between arguments and has new attack relations with literal orders. The argumentation semantics along with the framwork is compared with the prior answer set semantics. Since the answer sets for PLP do not always exist, the argumentation semantics is more expressive for PLP.

AB  - Offline and passive manner is conventionally adopted to monitor dam safety. From the viewpoint of system engineering, one dam can be regarded as an open, complicated and gigantic system. Its structural characteristics need be analyzed by the scientific integration of many subjects on information, artificial intelligence, material, engineering and management. A system implementing the fusion of theories and methods is presented in this paper. The system structure is composed of four fusion levels such as data, analysis, diagnosis and evaluation. The positive-thinking pattern is transformed into converse, systemic and feedback mode. The theories of knowledge engineering and information processing are crossed with traditionary mathematics and mechanics. The basic principles and representative methods on intelligent fusion are proposed in this paper. Dam safety can be monitored dynamically in real time by the proposed thought and methods.

AB  - Researchers of law investigate the relevant law features and identification of computer evidences, while computer scientists investigate the technological features and acquisition methods of computer evidences. As an interdiscipline of law and computer science, computer forensics must be studied from the view angle of law, computer science and their combination. The separation of them may result in the confusion of identification in law and technology in computer evidences. In this paper, relevant issues of computer forensics to criminal evidence, law and technology are jointly investigated. Since the technological methods and tools of computer forensics are important, a typical case study is presented and analyzed. Finally based on the analysis of the deficiency for the current work on law enforcement and technology, future work on the improvement of computer forensics is discussed from the viewpoint of both law and computer technology.

AB  - The support vector machine (SVM), as a novel type of learning machine, was used to develop a classification model of carcinogenic properties of 148 N-nitroso compounds. The seven descriptors calculated solely from the molecular structures of compounds selected by forward stepwise linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used as inputs of the SVM model. The obtained results confirmed the discriminative capacity of the calculated descriptors. The result of SVM (total accuracy of 95.2%) is better than that of LDA (total accuracy of 89.8%).

AB  - An adaptive output feedback controller is presented for a class of single-input-single-output (SISO) nonlinear systems preceded by an unknown hysteresis nonlinearity represented by the Preisach model. First, a novel model is developed to represent the hysteresis characteristic in order to handle the case where the hysteresis output is not directly measured. The model is motivated by the Preisach model but implemented by the neural networks (NN). Therefore, it is easily used for controller design. Then, a radius-basis-functional-neural-networks (RBF NN) adaptive controller based on the model estimation is presented by combining the highgain state observer. The updated laws and control laws of the controller are derived from Lyapunov stability theorem, so that the ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. At last, an example is used to verify the effectiveness of the controller. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Fuzzy discrete event systems (DESs) were proposed recently by Lin and Ying [19], which may better cope with the real-world problems of fuzziness, impreciseness, and subjectivity such as those in biomedicine. As a continuation of [19], in this paper, we further develop fuzzy DESs by dealing with supervisory control of fuzzy DESs. More specifically: 1) we reformulate the parallel composition of crisp DESs, and then define the parallel composition of fuzzy DESs that is equivalent to that in [19]. Max-product and max-min automata for modeling fuzzy DESs are considered, 2) we deal with a number of fundamental problems regarding supervisory control of fuzzy DESs, particularly demonstrate controllability theorem and nonblocking controllability theorem of fuzzy DESs, and thus, present the conditions for the existence of supervisors in fuzzy DESs; 3) we analyze the complexity for presenting a uniform criterion to test the fuzzy controllability condition of fuzzy DESs modeled by max-product automata; in particular, we present in detail a general computing method for checking whether or not the fuzzy controllability condition holds, if max-min automata are used to model fuzzy DESs, and by means of this method we can search for all possible fuzzy states reachable from initial fuzzy state in max-min automata. Also, we introduce the fuzzy n-controllability condition for some practical problems, and 4) a number of examples serving to illustrate the applications of the derived results and methods are described; some basic properties related to supervisory control of fuzzy DESs are investigated. To conclude, some related issues are raised for further consideration. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Compilation to Boolean satisfiability has become a powerful paradigm for solving scheduling problems. Scheduling under uncertainty for the teams of software project is an extension and application of Job-Shop scheduling. However, the problems that are under uncertainty cannot be compiled easily and efficiently to SAT. In this work we present separation predicate formulas as the natural tool for posing and solving scheduling under uncertainty for the teams of the software project. And we address this problem by introducing the theory of separation predicate that combines propositional logic and separation predicates. We define appropriate optimality criteria and develop algorithm for finding optimal scheduling strategies. We also develop a heuristic algorithm to estimate the enough scheduling time and the optimality of assignments. The approach is experimentally verified on an Uncertain Team-scheduling problem where the duration of each subtask is only known to be inside an interval of the form [1].

AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, functions as a biological barrier by extruding cytotoxic agents out of cells, resulting in an obstacle in chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer. In order to aid in the development of potential P-gp inhibitors, we constructed a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model of flavonoids as P-gp inhibitors based on Bayesian-regularized neural network (BRNN). A dataset of 57 flavonoids collected from a literature binding to the C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of mouse P-gp was compiled. The predictive ability of the model was assessed using a test set that was independent of the training set, which showed a standard error of prediction of 0.146 ± 0.006 (data scaled from 0 to 1). Meanwhile, two other mathematical tools, back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and partial least squares (PLS) were also attempted to build QSAR models. The BRNN provided slightly better results for the test set compared to BPNN, but the difference was not significant according to F-statistic at p = 0.05. The PLS failed to build a reliable model in the present study. Our study indicates that the BRNN-based in silico model has good potential in facilitating the prediction of P-gp flavonoid inhibitors and might be applied in further drug design. © Springer 2005.

AB  - A method of applying support vector machine (SVM) in speech recognition was proposed, and a speech recognition system for mandarin digits was built up by SVMs. In the system, vectors were linearly extracted from speech feature sequence to make up time-aligned input patterns for SVM, and the decisions of several 2-class SVM classifiers were employed for constructing an N-class classifier. Four kinds of SVM kernel functions were compared in the experiments of speaker-independent speech recognition of mandarin digits. And the kernel of radial basis function has the highest accurate rate of 99.33%, which is better than that of the baseline system based on hidden Markov models (HMM) (97.08%). And the experiments also show that SVM can outperform HMM especially when the samples for learning were very limited.

AB  - The frame of text classification system was presented. The high dimensionality in feature space for text classification was studied. The mutual information is a widely used information theoretic measure, in a descriptive way, to measure the stochastic dependency of discrete random variables. The measure method was used as a criterion to reduce high dimensionality of feature vectors in text classification on Web. Feature selections or conversions were performed by using maximum mutual information including linear and non-linear feature conversions. Entropy was used and extended to find right features commendably in pattern recognition systems. Favorable foundation would be established for text classification mining.

AB  - A prediction model for a consumption price index of tobacco by artificial neural network was set up. The data over the years was chosen as the training set, to confirm the network architecture of the prediction for tobacco consumption price index. The weight values of each layer on the network were calculated and stable stales and achieved. By the comparison of network precision, the layer number of the optimal hidden layer and the nodes of each hidden layer was obtained, define the optimal prediction model of tobacco consumption price index. The optimization method of Levernberg-Marquart was used to surmount the traditional BP algorithm defect of the slow convergence speed and hardly confirm the hidden layer and the nodes of hidden layer, making the learning time shorter. The urban tobacco consumption price index with the help of this model was predicted, and test samples used to verify the training results with the absolute error of -2.0 and the relative error of 2.0964%. The prediction numbers of certain city tobacco consumption price index of 3 years is 97.3752, 97.3973, and 97.4000, and a creditable conclusion is acquired. This method advances prediction precision and has referred value to this kind of problem.

AB  - In order to realize cooperation and resources share of systems in different areas, a kind of agent-swarm used to implement the function of cross-area decision and command was constructed with the application of swarm intelligence agent technology. In this agent swarm mode, the cooperations among individual agents were carried out through dynamical organization of the agent workgroup as a whole, and the agent swarm had a relative static hierarchy. Based on the research on dynamic cooperation organization and the static hierarchy of agent swarm, a framework model of cross-area decision and command organization used in a special application was proposed.

AB  - It is suggested that in sheet metal forming simulation, within each increment step of dynamic explicit non-linear finite element method, the fuzzy reasoning is adopted to estimate the states of stress and strain of the stamped part and to deal with the corresponding process expert knowledge. Moreover, a second order optimization model, taking the die opening radius, the blank holder force, and the drawbead constraint force as the design variables and the slightest wrinkling tendency without any fracture as the objective function, is established to determine automatically the above mentioned process conditions with the hierarchical optimization searching strategy. The numerical simulation of forming process of a typical Dashpot part is performed with the process conditions obtained by the proposed determination method in DYNAFORM and the results reveal a good agreement with the available conclusions and practical experience.

N1  - Funding text 1: L ast year, China witnessed several important events in science and technology. First, the Chinese government, headed by Premier Jiaobao Wen, organized several ministries and thousands of scientists and engineers to develop a middle-to long-term plan for strategic science and technology development. Second, the Chinese Academy of Sciences completed its 20-Year Forecast of Information Technology Development, part of its 20-Year Forecast Project of Science and Technology Development. Third, from 10–12 September, the National Natural Science Foundation of China sponsored the National Workshop on Future Directions of Artificial Intelligence to identify key areas for funding in the next decade. I attended the last event, where workshop attendees identified widespread AI applications as central to effectively using information in the era of networking and the Internet. They also concluded that such applications are the driving force behind future IT development. A variety of proposals were made at the workshop, but I suggested that researching and developing “zhijian” or knowware will be an important step toward next-generation IT and its widely used applications.

AB  - Due to its great potential value in applications and theory, artificial intelligence-based control strategies of brushless DC motor (BLDCM), especially fuzzy logic control methods, have been a focus in the literature. The main purpose of this paper is to develop a control algorithm that forces BLDCM to track speed trajectories with different motor moment of inertia. To achieve this, fuzzy control combined with adaptive scheme is developed for high-performance robust speed controller and the stability of the adaptive fuzzy controller is shown using Lyapunov methods. By using dSPACE tools, an implementation of the real-time control system model of BLDCM based on block-oriented programming tool Matlab/Simulink is proposed. The simulation and experimental results are illustrated to show very good static and dynamic performance with moment of inertia parameter variations.

AB  - Diagnostic systems depend on knowledge bases specifying the causal, structural or functional interactions among components of the diagnosed objects. A diagnostic specification in a diagnostic system is a semantic interpretation of a knowledge base. We introduce the notion of diagnostic specification morphism and some operations of diagnostic specifications that can be used to model knowledge transformation and fusion, respectively. The relation between diagnostic methods in the source system and the target system of a specification morphism is examined. Also, representations of diagnostic methods in a composed system modelled by operations of specifications are given in terms of the corresponding diagnostic methods in its component systems. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The characteristics of the Real-Time Multi-Task Operation System (RTOS) are introduced. A special RTOS (S-RTOS) is then designed based on a detailed analysis of the working characteristics of the intelligent electrical apparatus. The proposed S-RTOS overcomes such shortcomings of the traditional sequent structure software as complexity in the code structure, poor transportability and inconvenient extension. Furthermore, some advanced designs are adopted in S-RTOS, including the real-time design, the resource control, the task monitoring, the interruption management, etc. Essentials of the S-RTOS design relating to the schedule mode and the task distribution are also described in detail. The verification of the S-RTOS' s schedule core by application is presented at the end of the paper.

AB  - This paper uses ensemble learning technique to improve clustering performance. Since the training data used in clustering lacks the expected output, the combination of component learner is more difficult than that under supervised learning. Through aligning different clustering results and selecting component learners with the help of mutual information weight, this paper proposes a Bagging-based selective clusterer ensemble algorithm. Experiments show that this algorithm could effectively improve the clustering results.

AB  - One of the problems is the mergence of GIS and information technology. The development and change of GIS not only depend on a series of basic characteristics of GIS, but also depend on information technology (IT), from the merging process of GIS and IT; which shows the development of GIS is the process in which GIS merges with the mainstream information technology, and reflects the main development of information technology. Now it is a trend that GIS merges further with database technology, network technology, virtual reality technology, artificial intelligence technology and correspondence technology, and etc.

AB  - An extended class cover problem is presented and then it is reduced to a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Solving this problem is significantly important to construct a robust classification system. Therefore, through analyzing the parameters of the binary particle swarm optimization, the conclusion that the binary particle swarm optimization can not only explore the search space efficiently, but also utilize the apriority knowledge adequately, is drawn in this paper. Furthermore, a hybrid algorithm combined with the conventional greedy algorithm and binary particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to deal with the extended class cover problem. The proposed algorithm can get a better solution in less runtime and the simulated comparative results with other algorithms show its feasibility and validity.

AB  - Based on the early-established spatial model for 3D representation of acupoints, a comprehensive visible human model was developed, incorporated with a linked symbolic description regarding anatomical terms and their relations, especially for description of the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) knowledge. The model of the intelligent object, the organization of the semantic network, the display mode of TCM concepts and the extension of TCM contents were discussed. The relationships of dangerous acupoints and their anatomical structures were also originally explored. The TCM knowledge base system based on the network of intelligent object was addressed. A 3D anatomical atlas of acupuncture is being prepared.

AB  - Operational patterns are used to describe a set of on-line operational parameters which need to be determined on line, and an intelligent method based on neural network combined with improved chaotic genetic algorithm for optimal operational patterns is proposed to improve the operational level of copper converting furnace. Firstly, the optimal samples set is filtered from the historical samples set. Then, the functional relation with objective and technical parameters is trained by a neural network model. Finally, chaotic genetic algorithm with chaotic variables is used to search the optimal operational pattern. The running results of an intelligent system of optimal operational parameters based on the method in the process of copper converting furnace show that the output of converter increases by 6%, and the amount of the treated cool materials rises by 7.8%.

AB  - A hybrid modeling approach integrating case-based reasoning (CBR) into the first principles process model is developed for the laminar cooling process, which is difficult to describe with accurate mathematical models due to its complex nature (e.g., highly nonlinear, time varying, and spatially varying). The past cases most similar to the current operating condition are retrieved from the case base. The model parameters of the finite difference model for the current operating condition are found by reusing the solutions of the retrieved cases. The finite difference model can predict the through-thickness temperature evolutions of the moving strip during the cooling process. Experimental studies based on the industrial data from a steel company show the effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach.

AB  - In order to punctually provide feedbacks of business process performance information and guarantee continuous and correct execution of business process, a framework supporting real-time business process performance management was proposed based on the Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rule and process warehouse. And based on this framework, the architecture was constructed. With this scheme, process performance control logic was described in ECA rule and the process warehouse was used as the calculation model of process performance index. To satisfy real-time computing requirements of performance index, the real-time process warehouse was separated from historical process warehouse; the design of real-time process warehouse was designed in line with business process performance evaluation framework and the workflow reference model. Finally, a case study was introduced to illustrate that the business process performance control solution could be easily reset through the update of ECA rules so as to meet the agility and intelligence requirements of modern enterprises.

AB  - A new algorithm with high forecasting accuracy and global optimal property for peak load forecasting is proposed based on the support vector machine (SVM) method, where the cross-validation is introduced into hyper-parameter estimation in SVM to outperform the common cut and try method. In addition to the load variables, the temperature information, weekday and vacation information are taken into account in the input samples to improve the forecasting accuracy. The practical examples show that the accuracy of the SVM is 0.4%-0.8% higher than artificial neural network under the same load and weather conditions.

AB  - Traffic incident automatic detection is one of important issues for ITS research, especially, for advanced traffic management system and advanced traveler information system research. Automatic incident detection (AID) systems use algorithms to analyze traffic data and detect incidents quickly so as to reduce their adverse effects. Since 1960s a variety of freeway incident algorithms have been developed based on traffic flow theory, pattern recognition, statistical techniques and recently using artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic. In this paper, review of these existing incident detection algorithms, and the method of improving the performance of incident detection algorithm are presented.

AB  - Nearly half a century after Marvin Minsky predicted that computers would be as smart as humans, computing systems still cannot pass the Turing test. Despite impressive achievements in robotics, mathematical theorem proving, scientific classification, and advanced user interfaces, artificial intelligence remains elusive. Scientists and engineers have nearly realized Vannevar Bush's dream of a universal multimedia data-processing machine with the Internet and the World Wide Web. It is now possible to foresee the development of highly secure, highly available, self-programming, self-managing, and self-replicating computer networks. However, creating intelligent networks that can program, manage, and replicate themselves remains a major challenge. The China Knowledge Grid Research Group, established i n 2001, is exploring the operating principles of this future interconnection environment.

AB  - Self-organizing map (SOM) has been used in protein folding prediction when the HP model is employed. The existing work uses a square-like shape lattice with l = m × n points to represent the optimal compact structure of a sequence of l amino acids. In this paper, a general l′-size sequence of amino acids is self-organized in a two dimensional lattice with l (> l′) points. The obtained minimum configuration then has a flexible shape, in contrast to the compact structure limited in the lattice. To fulfil this extension, a new self-organizing map (SOM) technique is proposed to deal with the difficulty of the unsymmetric input and output spaces. New competition rules in the training phase are introduced and a local search method is applied to overcome the multi-mapping phenomena. Several HP benchmark examples with up to 36 amino acids are tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in this paper. © Imperial College Press.

AB  - To cope with situations in which a plant's dynamics are not precisely known, we consider the problem of supervisory control for a class of discrete event systems modeled by fuzzy automata. The behavior of such discrete event systems is described by fuzzy languages; the supervisors are event feedback and can only disable controllable events with any degree. In this new sense, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for a fuzzy language to be controllable. We also study the supremal controllable fuzzy sublanguage and the infimal controllable fuzzy superlanguage. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - This paper investigated the biological characteristics of palm print. The preprocessing plays an important role in identifying the ridge characteristics of palm due to the complexity and poor quality of the images. As a functional plug-in of the dermatoglyphics analysis and detection system, the template-based image preprocessing was proposed in this study, including histogram redistribution, ridge orientation, and skeletonization. Using this system, the automatic identification of ridges and triradiuses was accomplished with an effective result. The study demonstrated the feasibility of the method and the potential of the system for being applied as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for heredity diseases (e.g. mammary cancer and neurofibromatosis). © 2004 IPEM.

AB  - Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a branch of a newly developed form of artificial intelligence called swarm intelligence. It has been applied successfully to travel sales problem, job schedule, router choice and other combinatorial optimization problems. But it is still a new research topic in data mining. Parepinelli etc. proposed ACO classification algorithm to single database. The paper proposes ACO classification algorithm based on distributed database structure, and uses new heuristic computation and pheromone update methods which are different from Parepinelli's. The experiment shows that the method is effective.

AB  - This paper studies the exist prune algorithms of decision tree in machine learning of artificial intelligence, and proposes a new prune algorithm-failure-node prune algorithm. Usually, when a decision tree is pruned, the number of the tree's nodes will decrease and the correctness will also be cut down. The failure-node prune algorithm proposed in this paper can increase the correctness while the number of the tree's nodes is decreased when the data sets are quite deficient. Four typical databases obtained from CMU are used to do the experiments on the ID3 algorithm, the expected-error prune algorithm and the failure-node prune algorithm. In the experiments, it divides a data set into three parts, used two of them to form the training set and the third part as the testing set. The results of the experiments suggest the failure-node prune algorithm has a quite good pruning effect.

AB  - The need to solve complicated problems in the real world is the direct driving force for the quest of flexible logic system, which is the future of current development of logics. The theory of universal logic is a new flexible logic system, developed by He Hua-Can during his exploration of the flexibility of logic. This paper discusses the flexibility of probability logic based on the ideas and methods in the implementation of flexible logic. Theoretically, probability logic is a special example of the universal logics. So it is possible to build flexible probability logic in the framework of universal logics.

AB  - By using an artificial neural network (ANN) model, high measurement accuracy of integer harmonics can be obtained. The invalidation of an ANN model being used in non-integer harmonics analysis is pointed out. In order to detect non-integer harmonics precisely, an improved ANN model is presented in this paper. By combining the windowed fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm with the improved ANN model, we provide a new method for measurement of non-integer harmonics. The following approach is adopted. Firstly, the Hanning-windowed FFT algorithm processes the sampled signal. By this time, the number of harmonics and the orders of harmonics are obtained. Secondly, choose the number of neural nodes according to the number of harmonics. Thirdly, choose the initial values of orders of harmonics according to the result obtained from the Hanning-windowed FFT algorithm. Finally, by using the improved ANN model, non-integer harmonics can be detected precisely. The simulation results show that close non-integer harmonics can be separated from a signal with higher accuracy by using the method presented in the paper. It provides a reliable basis for managing harmonics.

AB  - In factored Markov decision process (FMDP) such as Robocup system, the effect to value evaluation of various states is different from each other within state attributes. There are some important state attributes that can determine the whole state value either uniquely, or at least, approximately. Instead of using the relevance among states to reduce the state space, this paper addresses the problem of curse of dimensionality in large FMDP by approximating state value function through feature vector extraction. A key contribution of this paper is that it reduces the computation complexity by constraints reduction in linear programming, speeds up the production of joint strategy by transplanting the value function to the more complex game in reinforcement learning. Experimental results are provided on Robocup free kick, demonstrating a promising indication of the efficiency of the approach and its' ability of transplanting the learning result. Comparing this algorithm to an existing state-of-the-art approach indicates that it can not only improve the learning speed, but also can transplant state value function to the Robocup with more players instead of learning again.

AB  - The study of Implicit Desire is essential to agent theory. This paper first analyzes insufficiency and inadequacy of the existing theories of implicit desire. Then logical semantics is employed to define a new kind of implicit desire-pm-desire consequence, to investigate its main properties, to compare it with the relevant work, and thereby to argue its rationality such as its accordance with intuitions and ability to improve the autonomy intelligent-agents, etc.

AB  - Model Base is important to Decision Support System. Traditional intelligent model base system depends on transcendental knowledge, and it is difficult to authentically implement intelligentization. To solve the problem, this paper makes following contributions: 1) Proposes the concepts of Explicit Intelligent Model, Implicit Intelligent Model, and Explicit Gene; 2) Proposes Mining Implicit Intelligent Model Algorithm Based on Gene Expression Programming (GEP-IIMA) and implements the intelligent model base system based on GEP-IIMA; 3) Studies the interface between the Implicit Intelligent Model Base (IIMB) system and GIS; 4) Gives compared experiments. IIMB is indeed an intelligent model base on it both the types and parameters of model are determined automatically by the GEP-IIMA. The comparison experiments show that the precision of the function model found by the GEP-IIMA is improved 14.9% than traditional method.

AB  - The potential for using the traditional technology of software agents to exploit the Web-based social intelligence is obstructed, because this technology is only suited to closed and small systems, and difficult to adapt to the Internet environment which the agent society emerging on Web is faced with. This environment will be participated in by a large number of heterogeneous agents, hence will be open, dynamically changing, and full of non-determining factors. This paper proposes a method system for supporting agent social activities, called SASA5, which aims at adopting the policy-driven social institution in the form of social-sector/federation as main line, and from five dimensions: information modeling, mediate service, rational negotiation, legality management, and user adjustment, creating an open, multi-dimensional, systematic, secure, and easy-to-transparently-adjust infrastructure for social activities, in order to support the effective development of social intelligence for agents.

AB  - Support vector machine (SVM) is a technique of classification based on the structural risk minimization principle, and a regression method with fine ability of generalization. In this paper, the SVM classification technique is first applied to recognize trajectories. Then the SVM regression method is employed to model the trajectory data. Thus the initial point can be effectively predicted. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithms has high precision, and the accuracy of trajectory prediction can be further improved based on trajectory recognition.

AB  - Intelligent behaviors of humans require the ability to predict the result of actions. McCarthy holds the view that reasoning about action plays an essential role in commonsense reasoning. In recent years, reasoning about action is a popular issue in AI domain and becomes a discussion subject in IJCAI for several years. Ramification problem is currently one of the central problems is reasoning about action. This paper describes some background and the main task of reasoning about action, recapitulates the ramification problem and points out the difficulty in it. Most of the current methods of reasoning about action cannot handle cyclic causal relation. This paper presents a solution to this problem. Firstly, based on modified causal theory of McCain and Turner, it puts forward an automatable procedure that transforms a syntactically restricted causal theory into a monotonic one without cyclic causality. Next, it proves the correctness of the procedure under causal closure semantic by showing that an interpretation is the model of the transformed theory if and only if it is the model of original theory. This paper also proves that the method yields the same results as that of McCain and Turner (1997) when the theory is stratified.

AB  - The existing morphological auto-associative memory models based on the morphological operations, typically including morphological auto-associative memories (auto-MAM) proposed by Ritter et al. and our fuzzy morphological auto-associative memories (auto-FMAM), have many attractive advantages such as unlimited storage capacity, one-shot recall speed and good noise-tolerance to single erosive or dilative noise. However, they suffer from the extreme vulnerability to noise of mixing erosion and dilation, resulting in great degradation on recall performance. To overcome this shortcoming, we focus on FMAM and propose an enhanced FMAM (EFMAM) based on the empirical kernel map. Although it is simple, EFMAM can significantly improve the auto-FMAM with respect to the recognition accuracy under hybrid-noise and computational effort. Experiments conducted on the thumbnail-sized faces (28 × 23 and 14 × 11) scaled from the ORL database show the average accuracies of 92%, 90%, and 88% with 40 classes under 10%, 20%, and 30% randomly generated hybrid-noises, respectively, which are far higher than the auto-FMAM (67%, 46%, 31%) under the same noise levels. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - This paper introduces an approach for image shadow removal by using pulse coupled neural network (PCNN), based on the phenomena of synchronous in the animal visual cortexes. Two shadow-removing criteria are proposed. These two criteria decide how to choose the optimal parameter (the linking strength β. The computer simulation results of shadow removal based on PCNN show that if these two criteria are satisfied, shadows are removed completly and the shadow-removed images are almost as the same as the original nonshadowed images. The shadow removal results are independent of changes of intensities of shadows in some range and variations of the places of shadows. When the first criterion is satisfied, even if the second criterion is not satisfied, as to natural grey images that have abundant grey levels, shadows also can be removed and PCNN shadow-removed images retain the shapes of the objects in original images. These two criteria also be used for color images by dividing a color image into three channels (R, G, B). For shadows varying drastically, such as the noisy points in images, these two criteria are still right, but difficult to satisfy. Therefore, this approach can efficiently remove shadows that do not include the random noise. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - A variety of methods and algorithms have been developed to solve NP-Hard problems in recent decades. In this paper, we are concerned with a relatively new algorithm based on animal behavioral adaptability and evolutionary computation, namely predatory search. When first introduced, the algorithm was implemented with restrictions based on solution cost as a simplification of distance adopted by search-intensive predators. Our research concentrates on exploring the possibility of using distance to restrict search area. Based on the research of Boese et al. (1994), we propose a type of predatory search algorithm restricted by solution distance (particularly bond distance), and compare it with the original algorithm based on three benchmark traveling salesman problems. The results indicate that both algorithms are suitable for solving the traveling salesman problems, while our proposed algorithm either outperforms or at least matches its predecessor with respect to both the running time and the quality of solutions. In addition, further experiments suggest that there exists a certain relationship between the two algorithms. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

AB  - A back-propagation neural network method has been developed to predict the stability of DNA/DNA duplexes. Calculated Tm with the present parameters fits the experimental values within reasonable errors (AD = 1.86 K, SEP = 1.99151, R2 = 0.9894 for NN1; AD = 1.59667 K, SEP = 2.03824, R2 = 0.99371 for NN2), and it has the advantage that the determinations of thermodynamic parameters are not needed.

AB  - One advantage of multi-objective genetic optimization algorithms over classical approaches is that many non-dominated solutions can be simultaneously obtained by their single run. In this paper, we proposed a fuzzy rule-based classifier for electrical load pattern classification by using multi-objective genetic algorithm and fuzzy association rule mining. Multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to automatically select the rules with better classification accuracy and interpretability, and the key concepts of fuzzy association rule mining are the bases of heuristic rule selection for improving the performance of genetic algorithm searching. Through computation experiments on a real power system, it is shown that the generated fuzzy rule-based classifier leads to high classification performance, and can supply more sufficient historical data for load forecasting of anomalous days, better performance of load forecasting is gained accordingly.

AB  - Temporal and spatial reasoning remains one of the most important parts in the artificial intelligence research. With their more and more applications in the fields of G1S, spatio-temporal database, CAD/CAM etc. ontology representation of spatio-temporal information is gaining recognition these years. Currently, the construction of spatio-temporal ontology is based on FOL, and can not utilize the Web ontology language OWL; this bans its applications on the semantic Web. To address this problem, the paper investigates how to use logic mapping from FOL to description logic to represent the formalized spatio-temporal ontology, and gives the concrete the OWL spatio-temporal ontology in protege environment.

AB  - The diversity, adaptation and memory of biological immune system attract much attention of researchers. Several optimal algorithms based on immune system have also been proposed up to now. The distance concentration-based artificial immune algorithm (DCAIA) is proposed to overcome defects of the classical artificial immune algorithm (CAIA) in this paper.

AB  - The mathematical results of this paper have already been used in computation on AI (artificial intelligence) logic reasoning in the first author's Ph.D dissertation at Northwestern Polytechnical University. In the process of uncertainties reasoning with universal logic, N-norm is the mathematical model of the first level operation. N-norm and N-generator are defined on interval [0,1]. We extend and improve the existing N-norm and TV-generator based on [0,1] interval in universal logic. Any interval [a, b] is called generalized interval here. We first give the definitions of generalized N-norm and generalized N-generator on generalized interval [a, b], then study their main properties: closeness, fixed point, universal not property, even equivalent property, etc. Then we give the classifications: normal TV-generator, strange TV-generator, center symmetrical TV-generator. Finally we prove the important generating theorem of generalized TV-generator and that of generalized TV-norm.

AB  - Due to the drawback that the welding arc length fluctuates fast in the short circuiting transfer high-speed welding process, a fuzzy logic control method is proposed to improve the arc stability, which uses the arc voltage as feedback parameter to control the high constant current for the sake of controlling arc. The system structure, fuzzy controller and experimental result are introduced. The experimental result shows that the fuzzy logic control system can control arc and make it stable rapidly and effectively, when the welding arc length fluctuates.

AB  - For solving the route guidance problem in intelligent transportation system (ITS), three classifications of route guidance systems were proposed according to the aim of route guidance system, the character of steady or dynamic state information and the available mode of route guidance. The key problems in the three main research fields including algorithm real time efficiency, dynamic route guidance algorithm and integration with traffic control system in route guidance system and their up-to-date study developments were analyzed. Combining analysis results and the possibility of practical application of route guidance system, several important problems in future research on route guidance algorithm were presented based on traveller psychology model, multi-index optimization, traffic flow forecast, more intelligent route guidance service and an algorithm model of distributed artificial intelligence.

AB  - In a hybrid system, the subsystems with discrete dynamics play a central role in a hybrid system. In the course of engineering machinery of cluster construction, the discrete control law is hard to obtain because the construction environment is complex and there exist many affecting factors. Hierarchically intelligent control, expert control and fuzzy control are introduced into the discrete subsystems of engineering machinery of cluster hybrid system, so as to rebuild the hybrid system and make the discrete control law easily and effectively obtained. The structures, reasoning mechanism and arithmetic of intelligent control are replanted to discrete dynamic, continuous process and the interface of the hybrid system. The structures of three types of intelligent hybrid system are presented and the human experiences summarized from engineering machinery of cluster are taken into account.

AB  - In multi-agent systems, autonomous agents may form coalition to increase the efficiency of problem solving. But the current coalition algorithm is very complex, and cannot satisfy the condition of optimality and stableness simultaneously. To solve the problem, an algorithm that uses the mechanism of distribution according to work for coalition formation is presented, which can achieve global optimal and stable solution in subadditive task oriented domains. The validity of the algorithm is demonstrated by both experiments and theory.

AB  - An agent-based data mining framework for the high-dimensional environment is built instead of the style of classical structural programming or the object-oriented programming. The framework supports the whole process of data mining of the high-dimensional environment. Belief-desire-joint intention agents are designed to fit the characteristic of the high-dimensional environment. At the same time, the syntax, semantics and reasoning rules of the agents are given. In the data mining system of the high-dimensional environment, agents need exchange messages. The cooperation behavior mechanism is adopted to complete the communication through the three-level pattern among agents that have their own fixed roles.

AB  - In cooperative multiagent systems, to learn the optimal policies of multiagents is very difficult. As the numbers of slates and actions increase exponentially with the number of agents, their action policies become more intractable. By learning these value functions, an agent can learn its optimal action policies for a task. If a task can be decomposed into several subtasks and the agents have learned the optimal value functions for each subtask, this knowledge can be helpful for the agents in learning the optimal action policies for the whole task when they are acting simultaneously. When merging the agents' independently learned optimal value functions, a novel multiagent online reinforcement learning algorithm LU-Q is proposed. By applying a transformation to the individually learned value functions, the constraints on [he optimal value functions of each subtask are loosened. In each learning iteration process in algorithm LU-Q, the agents' joint action set in a state is processed. Some actions of that state are pruned from the available action set according to the defined multiagent value function in LU-Q. As the items of the available action set of each state are reduced gradually in the iteration process of LU-Q, the convergence of the value functions is accelerated. LU-Q's effectiveness, soundness and convergence are analyzed, and the experimental results show that the learning performance of LU-Q is better than the performance of standard Q learning.

AB  - An important task for data mining is to discover interesting rules for the user. Unexpected rules shake user's domain knowledge, so they are always interesting to the user. The discovered knowledge and user's domain knowledge are expressed in uncertainty rule forms. The concept of rule's antecedent similarity measure and its calculating method are proposed. Three types of unexpected forms are given. The factors which affect rule unexpectedness are discussed and functions to measure rule unexpectedness are given. A method for discovering unexpected rules is studied and it is not limited by data mining algorithm which produces rules. Experimental result shows that the method is effective.

AB  - Although policy-gradient reinforcement learning (PGRL) has good convergence properties, the variance of policy gradient estimation in existing PGRL algorithms is usually large, which becomes a significant problem for policy gradient algorithms in theory and in practice. This paper proposes a new policy gradient algorithm with reward baselines - Istate-Grbp. The Istate-Grbp algorithm is an extension of the Istate-GPOMDP algorithm by introducing reward baselines to reduce the variance in policy gradient estimation. It is proved that adding a reward baseline in previous Istate-GPOMDP does not influence the bias of policy gradient estimation, and the optimal reward baseline to minimize the variance is also derived, which is the average of the observed rewards. The experimental results on a typical POMDP problem show that the variance of Istate-Grbp is much smaller than previous Istate-GPOMDP and the learning efficiency and convergence speed are both improved.

AB  - Least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs), a nonlinear kernel based machine was introduced to investigate the prospects of application of this approach in modelling water vapor and carbon dioxide fluxes above a summer maize field using the dataset obtained in the North China Plain with eddy covariance technique. The performances of the LS-SVMs were compared to the corresponding models obtained with radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. The results indicated the trained LS-SVMs with a radial basis function kernel had satisfactory performance in modelling surface fluxes; its excellent approximation and generalization property shed new light on the study on complex processes in ecosystem.

AB  - A quantitative structure-mobility relationship (QSMR) was developed for the absolute mobilities of a diverse set of 277 organic and inorganic acids in capillary electrophoresis based on the descriptors calculated from the structure alone. The heuristic method (HM) and the radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) were utilized to construct the linear and nonlinear prediction models, respectively. The prediction results were in agreement with the experimental values. The HM model gave a root-mean-square (RMS) error of 3.66 electrophoretic mobility units for the training set, 4.67 for the test set, and 3.88 for the whole data set, while the RBFNN gave an RMS error of 2.49, 3.19, and 2.65, respectively. The heuristic linear model could give some insights into the factors that are likely to govern the mobilities of the compounds, however, the prediction results of the RBFNN model seem to be better than that of the HM. © 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The rapid growth of digital multimedia and Internet technologies has made copyright protection, copy protection, and integrity verification three important issues in the digital world. To solve these problems, the digital watermarking technique has been presented and widely researched. Traditional watermarking algorithms are mostly based on discrete transform domains, such as the discrete cosine transform, discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Most of these algorithms are good for only one purpose. Recently, some multipurpose digital watermarking methods have been presented, which can achieve the goal of content authentication and copyright protection simultaneously. However, they are based on DWT or DFT. Lately, several robust watermarking schemes based on vector quantization (VQ) have been presented, but they can only be used for copyright protection. In this paper, we present a novel multipurpose digital image watermarking method based on the multistage vector quantizer structure, which can be applied to image authentication and copyright protection. In the proposed method, the semifragile watermark and the robust watermark are embedded in different VQ stages using different techniques, and both of them can be extracted without the original image. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in terms of robustness and fragility. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - An ant colony algorithm-based approach to assembly sequence generation and optimization of mechanical products is presented in this article. For diverse assemblies, the approach generates different amount of ants cooperating to find optimal solutions with the least reorientations during assembly processes. Based on assembly by disassembly philosophy, a candidate list composed by feasible and reasonable disassembly operations that are derived from disassembly matrix guides sequences construction in the solution space expressed implicitly, and so guarantees the geometric feasibility of sequences. The state-transition rule and local- and global-updating rules are defined to ensure acquiring of the optimal solutions. Cases are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the characteristics of the algorithm are discussed. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2004.

AB  - The paradox of fuzzy modeling is recognized due to the co-existence of its effectiveness of solving uncertain problems in the real world and the skepticism of its reasonability in membership function. In this paper, a revised membership function by means of supervised machine learning is introduced, in which the membership function curve is revised from the learning data of existing samples. It points that the information from supervised machine learning by samples is in the same argument to the statistic data from observation in the probability model. The formulations of supervised fuzzy machine learning by samples for revising the membership function are presented, and satisfactory results by the revised membership function compared with the experimental data are shown. It steps forward in promoting the pragmatic application of fuzzy methods in real world problems. © 2005 Springer.

AB  - There are three representative categories of optimizing model and algorithms for Train Operation Adjustment (TOA), simulation means, operational method and artificial intelligence ways. The sort of TOA characterizes hard restriction, multi-target, dynamic, real-time and combinatorial optimization. Targeting at minimization of the rate of delay, therefore, we can solve the TOA problem by searching the optimal drawing sequence of candidate trains within feasible solutions on consideration of present railway transport organization in China. Thus, an optimizing model for double-track TOA has been proposed in the paper based on the mixed 0-1 linear programming. The algorithm of tabu search was applied to search the optimal drawing sequence of trains. Finally, further application in part section of Jing-Guang line and Jing-Hu line testifies the validity and reliability of the model and algorithms.

AB  - It is difficult to represent process design knowledge for hybrid process industry due to its long production cycle, complicated production process and difficulty in retrieval and representation of process design knowledge. Representing its process design scheme with traditional single-shot case based reasoning system tended to bring huge and redundant case bases and low resolution efficiency. To deal with this problem, a novel intelligent process planning scheme based on Hierarchical Case-Based Reasoning (HCBR) system was introduced based on characteristics of hybrid process industry, which not only utilized the advantages of CBR but also avoided the defects of case redundancy and low retrieval speed. Furthermore, the knowledge representation of different hierarchical cases, organization structure of case bases and the hierarchical reasoning algorithm of case retrieval were discussed, adaptation and learning was presented with a process design example of a steel product to validate the availability. Finally, the framework of intelligent process design systems based on HCBR was provided and the advantages were summarized.

AB  - Electrical power meter is manually recorded, not only wasting a lot of time but also making data processing very difficult, because the terminal clients are distributed in different living districts. The mechanical-electric recording meters are adopted, which have characteristics of both mechanical-recording meters recording for non-lost data and electric-recording meters programming for interfaces. The used quantity of electrical power can be accounted and stored intelligently at the terminal client, using single chip micro-computer and related technology. Intelligent recording meters for different terminal clients are connected as an unit of multi-computer communicating system through RS-485 bus. Personal computers served as servers can communicate with a micro-computer of the multi-computer communicating system through RS-232 bus. The hardware and software system of multi-client communication are developed for the intelligent management system of electric power. The remoter recording, buying and controlling electric power are provided in this system.

AB  - Planning is a main research field in artificial intelligence, which has a broad application background. In recent years, the focus has shifted to the problem of planning in dynamic nondeterministic environments. This paper presents a novel continual planning system, POMDPRS, which combines POMDP and PRS to gain stronger abilities of adapting to dynamic nondeterministic environments. In this system authors substitute the probabilistic distribution belief model and the maximum utility principle of POMDP for the first-order logic belief representation and plan selection mechanism of PRS; on the other hand, adopt the continual planning mechanism of PRS, which interleaves plan generation and execution, to make the POMDP decision in dynamic environments more efficient under some conditions.

AB  - Particle filter is a new real time inference algorithm, which is based on Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo method. Because of its unique characteristics such as being flexible, easy to implement, and parallelizable, and being efficient for processing nonlinear problems, particle filter becomes a new and very promising hot topic in applied statistics, signal processing, and artificial intelligence communities. Moreover, it has been applied to many applications such as object tracking and etc. The biggest problem which influences the estimation performance in a particle filter is sample depletion brought by resampling step. This paper focuses on solving this problem from the representation method of particles, and an EM-based Gaussian mixture particle filter is presented. It is demonstrated by computer simulation and visual tracking that the proposed method can reduce the need of sampling numbers and improve the estimation performance of particle filter.

AB  - In order to improve the capability of dynamic obstacle avoidance for autonomous mobile robot, a method of dynamic obstacle avoidance based on delay-time compensation was presented. This method makes decisions according to the vision information acquired and improves on the effect of obstacles' localization. During the course of the obstacle avoidance, this method makes the path planning more quickly for the reason that the velocity and the direction of the obstacles into account are not taken, which makes the method more applicable for mobile robots' navigation in unknown or partially unknown environment. The experiment indicates the method is feasible and valid.

AB  - A new approach of global motion planning for mobile robot under dynamic environment based on genetic algorithms is presented in the case when the multiple obstacles are moving in a certain field. It makes the robot avoid obstacles, and take the shortest period of time from starting point to the target point with the consideration of restriction on velocity and acceleration of the robot. In order to utilize the genetic algorithm to conduct the motion planning fast and steadily, the complex two dimension coding problem is converted into the one dimension one, and the fitness function meets not only the restriction on velocity and acceleration, but also the requirement of dynamic obstacle avoidance and the shortest period of time. Experimental results in simulation prove the method is correct and feasible.

AB  - The conception of dynamic referencing circle was introduced, and a shooting algorithm for soccer robot was proposed to improve the shoot success ratio. The motion trail of the shooting robot looks like a Archimedean axiom in the proposed algorithm. The simulation shows that this algorithm shortens the distance of robot-moving, increases the impulse of bumping ball and therefore increases the shoot success ratio in the situation of station ball as well as dynamic ball.

AB  - Based on the deep analysis of previous shooting algorithms, an improved shooting method is proposed. The shooting track and shooting point are calculated through the shooting zone and tangential arc, respectively. The new approach is fit to any original angle of shooting robot and has a smooth transition from beeline to curve. Moreover, the oscillation of robot induced by adjusting original angle is also eliminated.

AB  - In this paper, a unified image retrieval framework based on both cered annotations and visual features is proposed. In this framework, a set of statistical models are built based on visual features of a small set of manually labeled images to represent semantic concepts and used to propagate keywords to other unlabeled images. These models are updated periodically when more images implicitly labeled by users become available through relevance feedback. In this sense, the keyword models serve the function of accumulation and memorization of knowledge learned from user-provided relevance feedback. Furthermore, two sets of effective and efficient similarity measures and relevance feedback schemes are proposed for query by keyword scenario and query by image example scenario, respectively. Keyword models are combined with visual features in these schemes. In particular, a new, entropy-based active learning strategy is introduced to improve the efficiency of relevance feedback for query by keyword. Furthermore, a new algorithm is proposed to estimate the keyword features of the search concept for query by image example. It is shown to be more appropriate than two existing relevance feedback algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - In [1], Özdemir and Akarun proposed an intercluster separation (ICS) fuzzy clustering algorithm. The ICS algorithm is useful in combined quantization and dithering. However, there are two errors in the update equations for the ICS algorithm. This correspondence first points out these errors and gives their corrections. Since the parameters m, c, and γ are important factors in the performance of ICS, we also conduct a theoretical analysis of these ICS parameters. In order to analyze the parameters in ICS, we devise a theorem for the calculation of the Hessian matrix from the ICS objective function. We establish the fixed-point property of ICS based on the decomposition of the Hessian matrix and then analyze the effect of the parameters. Finally, we propose a numerical approach in choosing the appropriate parameters m and γ for ICS. These experimental results give a better numerical perspective on the effect of parameters in ICS and have conclusions consistent with our theoretical analysis. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - The condition assessment of large generator main insulation is an important research subject in electrical engineering field, and the key destination is to assess the aging condition of insulation based on the nondestructive parameters. A new artificial intelligent assessment method based on the combination of fuzzy math theory and artificial neutral network (ANN) is proposed in order to overcome the disadvantages of traditional insulation condition assessment based on the threshold model. Firstly, the 3 layers of BP ANN are established with 4 fuzzy outputs, which are the degrees of membership to four fuzzy subsets of insulation condition respectively, and 28 inputs corresponding to 28 nondestructive parameters of insulation respectively. Secondly, the ANN with fuzzy outputs is trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt fast training algorithm with the goal error of 0.0001, and the ability of condition evaluation of the network is verified by five 18 kV/300 MW practical stator bars. Finally, the intelligent evaluating software of main insulation based on MATLAB is developed. The research results show that the technique could assess the aging condition of stator bar insulation effectively and accurately.

AB  - It is hard to apply reinforcement learning algorithms to solve elevator group control problem in a building with more floors and elevators. This is mainly because of low convergence speed of reinforcement learning algorithms. It is necessary to partition state space into several regions and establish a reinforcement learning system with partitioning function. The system framework and its inside performance principle have a general significance and can be applied to optimal control problem with large state space. A zoning algorithm based partitioning module was developed and the performance results show the advantage of such system.

AB  - Taking part of the Shanghai electric system, which is in an accident, as a restoration target, the Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) were used to solve the problem of the early search of the net, then the Tabu search was used to search for the fastest restoration path. After these searches, C++ was used to compile the BFS and the DFS; also it was used to establish the Tabu list. The result shows that the optimal restore path can be selected in power system restoration.

AB  - A new Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm PSO with velocity mutation operator (PSOVMO), was presented. In the algorithm, the searching speed (v) rather than the position (x) was used as the mutation object. A critical velocity was set in every iteration and the value of the critical velocity decreased according to exponential series in every iteration. In every iteration starting from the mutation to the end of the whole searching loop, as long as |vi,d|, the ith particle's absolute value of searching velocity on the dimension d, is greater than the critical velocity, the value of Vi,d was reset according to some probability, making vi,d distributed stochastically in the range of [-vmax, vmax], through the position updated formula (xi, d=xi,d + vi,d), originally converged particles were driven to around the former position, so the mutation was gotten. The contrastive experiments of four multi-peak testing functions Ackley, Schaffer f6, Griewank and Rastrigin, indicated that PSOVMO is greatly superior to original PSO as well as PSO with mutation via common methods.

AB  - A method in which an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used to compute the point of the shoot in RoboCup simulation game was proposed. This ANFIS is a 4-input and single output Sugeno system. There are 4 inputs of the system: X, Y coordinates of the shooter and X, Y coordinates of the goalie. The output of the system is the Y coordinate of the shoot point. The system is composed of the antecedent network and consequent network. The training data are gathered during the shoot of many RoboCup simulation competitions. After training the data, ANFIS can automatically adjust the shape of the antecedent membership function and the consequent weight. So the mapping relationship between the inputs and the output can be accurately described. The method can increase the successful probability of the shoot. After it was applied to the China Robot Competition 2004, the champion was gained, which proves that the method is efficient.

AB  - Multi-agent systems form a particular type of distributed artificial intelligence systems. In this paper based on basic reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning with special context is proposed. The method is applied to RoboCup to learn coordination among agents. In experiments, the game field is divided into different areas, and the action choice is made dependent on the area in which the ball is currently located, and spaces of state and action decreased, and then the optimal joint policy is determined. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - This paper presents pattern formation in generalized cellular automata (GCA) by varying parameters of classic game of life. Different dynamic behaviors are classified. The influence of remembrance of dynamic behavior of GCA is also studied. Experiments show the emergence of the self-organizing patterns that is analogous with life forms at the edge of chaos, which consist of certain nontrivial structure and go through periods of growth, maturity and death. We describe these experiments and discuss their potential as alternative way for creating artificial life and generative art, and as a new method for pattern genesis.

AB  - Ensemble learning algorithms train multiple component learners and then combine their predictions. In order to generate a strong ensemble, the component learners should be with high accuracy as well as high diversity. A popularly used scheme in generating accurate but diverse component learners is to perturb the training data with resampling methods, such as the bootstrap sampling used in bagging. However, such a scheme is not very effective on local learners such as nearest-neighbor classifiers because a slight change in training data can hardly result in local learners with big differences. In this paper, a new ensemble algorithm named Filtered Attribute Subspace based Bagging with Injected Randomness (FASBIR) is proposed for building ensembles of local learners, which utilizes multimodal perturbation to help generate accurate but diverse component learners. In detail, FASBIR employs the perturbation on the training data with bootstrap sampling, the perturbation on the input attributes with attribute filtering and attribute subspace selection, and the perturbation on the learning parameters with randomly configured distance metrics. A large empirical study shows that FASBIR is effective in building ensembles of nearest-neighbor classifiers, whose performance is better than that of many other ensemble algorithms. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Oriented to the demands of vast RS information management for RS image retrieval, the applications of spectral features are discussed by taking hyperspectral RS image as an example. It is proposed that spectral features-based retrieval includes two modes: retrieval based on point mask and polygon mask. The most key issues in retrieval are spectral features extraction and similarity measure. The spectral vector can be used to retrieval directly, and the spectral angle and spectral information divergence (SID) are effective in similarity measure. The local maximum and minimum in reflectance spectral curve, corresponding to reflectance apex and absorption apex, can be used to retrieval also, but effective matching strategy should be adopted. The quantitative indexes for spectral curves such as moment, fractal and entropy are not suitable to retrieval because of poor similarity measure performance.

AB  - A hybrid genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization method (HGAPSO) is presented to handle distribution network reconfiguration problem. The proposed method, which combines the superiority in both genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), displays more excellent performance than GA and PSO. In HGAPSO, some individuals are manipulated by PSO, the others follow the formula of GA and evolution information is shared by each agent. Adaptive parameters mechanism and better fitness individuals surviving rules are adopted. The test results on IEEE 16-bus, IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus distribution networks show the prominent efficiency and significant global optima searching performance of HGAPSO.

AB  - The behavioral responses of a tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) school to low (0.13 mg/L), moderate (0.79 mg/L) and high (2.65 mg/L) levels of unionized ammonia (UIA) concentration were monitored using a computer vision system. The swimming activity and geometrical parameters such as location of the gravity center and distribution of the fish school were calculated continuously. These behavioral parameters of tilapia school responded sensitively to moderate and high UIA concentration. Under high UIA concentration the fish activity showed a significant increase (P < 0.05), exhibiting an avoidance reaction to high ammonia condition, and then decreased gradually. Under moderate and high UIA concentration the school's vertical location had significantly large fluctuation (P < 0.05) with the school moving up to the water surface then down to the bottom of the aquarium alternately and tending to crowd together. After several hours' exposure to high UIA level, the school finally stayed at the aquarium bottom. These observations indicate that alterations in fish behavior under acute stress can provide important information useful in predicting the stress.

AB  - Cell proliferation, differentiation and death are controlled by a multitude of cell-cell signals and loss of this control has devastating consequences. Prominent among these regulat, ory signals is the cytokine superfamily, which has crucial functions in the development, differentiation and regulation of immune cells. In this study, a support vector machine (SVM)-based method was developed for predicting families and subfamilies of cytokines using dipeptide composition. The taxonomy of the cytokine superfamily with which our method complies was described in the Cytokine Family cDNA Database (dbCFC) and the dataset used in this study for training and testing was obtained from the dbCFC and Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP). The method classified cytokines and non-cytokines with an accuracy of 92.5% by 7-fold cross-validation. The method is further able to predict seven major classes of cytokine with an overall accuracy of 94.7%. A server for recognition and classification of cytokines based on multi-class SVMs has been set up at http://bioinfo.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huangni/CTKPred/. © The Author 2005.

AB  - We report a new method of sensing a three-dimensional (3D) object surface with an arbitrary geometric shape. In this approach, the first-order beams diffracted from two acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) interfere with each other to form a spatial carrier that is used to encode the depth information from the 3D object surface. A direct digital synthesizer is utilized to control two AODs to generate sequentially spatial carriers with different spatial frequencies so that a modified temporal phase-unwrapping technique can be applied for decoding the shape information of the test surface. Preliminary experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. © 2005 Optical Society of America.

AB  - In now multi-agent systems, the underlying networks are always dynamic and the network topologies are always changed in the operation. Therefore, the coordination of agents shall be adjusted for the dynamic network topology. Aiming at the dynamics of underlying network topology, a novel adaptive multi-agents coordination model is explored in this paper. In the paper, a series of algorithms for multi-agent task and resource negotiation are provided. The provided algorithms consider the factors of network topology and agent distribution, and can implement effective task allocation and resource negotiation for current network topology. Therefore, the adaptation of agent coordination for dynamic underlying network topology can be achieved, which is also proved by the case studies and performance analyses in the paper. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Efficient computation of the largest modulus eigenvalues of a real anti-symmetric matrix is a very important problem in engineering. Using a neural network to complete these operations is in an asynchronous manner and can achieve high performance. This paper proposes a functional neural network (FNN) that can be transformed into a complex differential equation to do this work. Firstly, the mathematical analytic solution of the equation is received, and then the convergence properties of this FNN are analyzed. The simulation result indicates that with general initial complex values, the network will converge to the complex eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue whose imaginary part is positive, and modulus is the largest of all eigenvalues.

AB  - A new kernel-based learning algorithm, called kernel weighted maximum margin discriminant analysis (KWMMDA), is presented in this paper. Different from the previous discriminant analysis algorithms based on the traditional Fisher discriminant criterion, KWMMDA is derived based on a new discriminant criterion, called weighted maximum margin criterion (WMMC). The better performance of KWMMDA is demonstrated by experiments on real data set. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - On minor component analysis (MCA) neural networks, a new algorithm is proposed. It is a self-stabilizing MCA algorithm, which means that the sign of the temporal change of the weight vector length is independent of the presented input vector. Algorithms without this property may suffer fluctuations and divergence. With suitable conditions on the initial weight vector and learning rate, a rigorous global convergence proof is given. The techniques used in the proof will be useful in many research issues such as independent component analysis, principle component analysis, etc. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Efficient computation of the largest eigenvalue and the smallest eigenvalue of a real symmetric matrix is a very important problem in engineering. Using neural networks to complete these operations is in an asynchronous manner and can achieve high performance. This paper proposes a concise functional neural network (FNN) expressed as a differential equation and designs steps to do this work. Firstly, the mathematical analytic solution of the equation is received, and then the convergence properties of this FNN are fully gained. Finally, the computing steps are designed in detail. The proposed method can compute the smallest eigenvalue and the largest eigenvalue whether the matrix is non-definite, positive definite or negative definite. Compared with other methods based on neural networks, this FNN is very simple and concise, so it is very easy to realize. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Threshold selection is an important topic and also a critical preprocessing step for image analysis, pattern recognition and computer vision. In this letter, a novel automatic image thresholding approach only from the support vectors is proposed. It first fits the 1D histogram of a given image by support vector regression (SVR) to obtain all boundary support vectors and then sifts automatically so-needed (multi-) threshold values directly from the support vectors rather than the optimized extrema of the fitted histogram in which finding the extrema is, in general, difficult. The proposed approach is not only computationally efficient but also does not require prior assumptions whatsoever to be made about the image (type, features, contents, stochastic model, etc.). Such an algorithm is most useful for applications that are supposed to work with different (and possibly initially unknown) types of images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can select the thresholds automatically and effectively, and the resulting images can preserve the main features of the components of the original images very well. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Intelligent deep drawing for axisymmetric workpieces is an important research field of intelligent sheet metal forming, and real-time identification of parameters is a key technology for intelligent deep drawing. This paper presents a feed-forward neural network model based on the LM algorithm (put forward by Levenberg and Marquardt), which is established to realize real-time identification of material properties and friction coefficient for deep drawing of an axisymmetric workpiece. Compared with the previous BP model (neural network based on back propagation algorithm) and GA-ENN (evolutionary neural network based on genetic algorithm) model, the error goal of parameter identification by the LM model is stepped downward to a new level. Therefore, accurate parameter identification, which provides preconditions as well as assurance for accurate prediction and control, lays the basis for intelligent deep drawing of sheet metal. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Because of the difficulty to obtain the traffic flow information of lanes at non-detector intersections in most metropolises of the world, based on the relationships between the lanes of signal-controlled intersections, cluster analysis and stepwise regression are integrated to predict the traffic volume of lanes at non-detector isolated controlled intersections. First cluster analysis is used to cluster the lanes of non-detector isolated signal-controlled intersections and the lanes of all signal-controlled intersections with detectors. Then, by the results of cluster analysis, the traffic volume samples are selected randomly and stepwise regression is used to predict the traffic volume of lanes at non-detector isolated signal-controlled intersections. The method is tested by the traffic volume data of lanes of the road network of Nanjing city. The problem of predicting the traffic volume of lanes at non-detector isolated signal-controlled intersections was resolved and can be widely used in urban traffic flow guidance and urban traffic control in cities without enough intersections equipped with detectors.

AB  - This paper discusses the shortcomings of Dempster's rule, Yager's rule and other rules, and then presents a modified combination rule to deal with consistence or inconsistence evidences obtained from multiple sources. The modified rule adapts AND-operation to combine consistent evidences and reflects the intersection of focal elements, and allocates the conflict probability to very inconsistence focus element according to its average supported degree. Experiments show that the new combination rule is very reliable and rational for all kinds of evidences including highly conflicting evidences.

AB  - An automated negotiation mechanism for resource allocation in grid is presented. The mechanism supports the dynamic adjustment and matching of the user's requirement and the resource service. In the mechanism, user's agent safeguards his interest. User's agent and resource gradually adjust theirs interest, change their requests to make the user's complex requirements match the resource services. This negotiation process is supervised by the negotiation-tunnel agent. At last, a simulation environment is established based on the GridSim toolkits and the simulation experiments indicate that the mechanism can eliminate the misfit between the user's requirement and the resource service, and can keep a fine efficiency within certain range.

AB  - In order to resolve the low level currency for dispatching orders, many dimensions theory and technology were applied into the system. The system was designed with the core of workflow management to realize dispatching orders process definition, foundation and execution. The system architecture not only described the theory, technology, service and realization architecture, but also the structure, function and interface. The theory architecture consists of Spatio-Temporal, Net-Flow and Intelligence theory. The technology architecture is the technology way adopted for the system, which includes workflow management technology, templet technology, and navigation-based automatic generation software technology. The service architecture defines the process capability in order to satisfy now and future requirement. The system adopts J2EE architecture based on MVC paradigm. The implementation of the system based on workflow covers 4 periods, such as process definitions and optimization, system development and execution. Shared and concentration data resource and workflow of the system is built. The universal dispatching orders system is realized.

AB  - As the detection key in symmetric watermarking scheme can be used to forge or remove watermarks from digital works, it is required that the detection key be secret in watermark detection procedures. Based on zero-knowledge and proof of knowledge concepts and protocols in Cryptology, zero-knowledge watermark detection protocols can make the verifier believe the presence of a watermark in a disputed digital work while not compromising the detection key. The security requirements of a publicly verifiable zero-knowledge watermark detection scheme are outlined in this paper. Then a publicly verifiable commitment scheme and a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge protocol which proves knowing the discrete logarithm of a committed value are presented. Finally, using the above scheme and protocol as building blocks, a publicly verifiable zero-knowledge watermark detection protocol is proposed and its security considerations are addressed.

AB  - This paper mainly fills the gap of diagnosis test for non-observable common variables or high cost of testing common variables. The concept of replacement test is presented as a new alternative to diagnosis test. The concept of relevant replacement test is proposed for some observations, and makes best use of the effects of component replacement upon the observations of the system being diagnosed to characterize the discrimination of candidate diagnoses, and the generation of new conflicts. Based on it, the concept of replacing decomposition for diagnostic problems is proposed by virtue of the characteristics of replacement, and the decomposition of the system being diagnosed through replacing the components in the intersection set of some subsystems with normal components directly is investigated. In non-observable common variables or high cost of testing common variables, the results in this paper can improve the adaptation and the effectiveness of diagnosis tests, reduce the cost of the test, and provide a theoretical basis for decomposing the system being diagnosed.

AB  - The principle of fuzzy comprehensive assessment and artificial neural network is presented. The limitation of general BP neural network in studying the complex question is analyzed. According to the construction method of fuzzy artificial neural network (FANN) model, its application in quantitative evaluation of mine structure is discussed. Combined with the real data of Baodian Coal Mine, the model of FANN is set up and trained to predict the complexity of mine structure in non-exploiting field. The result shows that the convergence speed of FANN is fast and the effect of prediction is better than general BP neural network.

AB  - One-way delay (OWD) traces are important measurements for analyzing end-to-end performance on the Internet. It is still a great challenge to provide a scalable solution for large-scale OWD measurement. Because the docks at end systems are usually not synchronized, the OWD measurements are often inaccurate. For the more challenging case with clock resets to some reference times during the measurement, the OWD measurements are more inaccurate. Furthermore, the measurement data often exhibit considerable network-induced noise when the network is heavily loaded. All the existing OWD measurement techniques, such as linear programming and convex-hull approach (CHA), try to solve this problem by deterministic mathematics model. However, they often fail to distinguish clock resets from temporary Internet congestion. Based on the fuzzy-clustering analysis, this paper proposes a new algorithm to estimate and remove the clock skews and resets from measurement results. This algorithm has been implemented as a tool called fuzzy-based OWD corrector (FOC). The paper then presents OWD measurements of several Internet paths using FOC. Numerical experiments demonstrate that FOC is more accurate and robust than the existing techniques. FOCs computation complexity O(N) is similar to that of CHA and its computing time is much less than that of convex-hull technique. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Landslide hazard is a complex system of holism, dynamic, open and random characteristics; and the artificial neural network model is a nonlinear dynamic system, which is fit for regional landslide hazard risk prediction. The BP model for the zonation prediction of the landslide hazard risk is established. Applying BP model and GIS technology, the landslide hazard comprehensive prediction of New Badong County is carried out. Based on hazard evaluating and vulnerability estimating, the landslide risk after the completion of Three Gorges Reservoir is predicted in study area. The applicability of BP model for landslide hazard risk prediction is proved. At the same time, the existing questions and the possible solving ways are put forward.

AB  - In this paper a new discretization algorithm of continue attributes in rough set is offered. Firstly, a information entropy is defined for every candidate cut point and treated as a measurement of importance. On the basis of that, a discretization algorithm of continue attributes in rough set for selecting cut points is illustrated. Finally, a group of data set is applied to test the performance of the algorithm and the experiment result is compared with other discretization algorithm. The experiment result shows that the algorithm is effective, and keeps a high computing efficiency when the number of candidate cut point increase.

AB  - As one of effective automated reasoning methods, Tableau has been apply to many important fields. Tableau methods with generalized quantifiers are very difficulty for computer to implement. Because the number of the branches extended is very large, a Boolean pruning method was proposed in many-valued logic. Tableau rules with such quantifiers can been simplified by providing a link between signed formulas and upset/downset in Boolean set lattices. On the basis of the presented Boolean pruning method, authors research on simplifying Tableau reasoning method for generalized meet and join to build a set of reasoning methods with generalized quantifiers in first-order many-valued logic. Through the analyses of examples and compare its performance to former approach, the result shows the improved Tableau method can have a great enhancement of the inference efficiency.

AB  - An artificial neural network model is developed to predict percent human intestinal absorption (%FA) of compounds from their molecular structural parameters. These parameters are the polar molecular surface area (PSA), the fraction of polar molecular surface area (FPSA, polar molecular surface area/ molecular surface area), the sum of the net atomic charges of oxygen atoms (QO), the sum of the net atomic charges of nitrogen atoms with net negative atomic charges (QN), the sum of the net atomic charges of hydrogen atoms attached to oxygen or nitrogen atoms (QH), and the number of carboxyls (HCOOH). For a training set of 85 compounds and a test set of 10 compounds, root mean squared errors (RMSE) between experimental %FA values and calculated/predicted %FA values are 8.86% and 14.1%, respectively.

AB  - Simultaneous approximation of a function and its derivatives are required in many science and engineering applications. There have been many studies on the simultaneous approximation capability of feedforward neural networks (FNNs). Most of the studies are, however, only concerned with density or feasibility of performing simultaneous approximation with FNNs, and no quantitative estimation on approximation accuracy of the simultaneous approximation is given. Moreover, all existing density or feasibility results are established in the uniform metric only, and provide no solution to topology specification of the FNNs used. In this paper, by means of the Bernstein-Durrmeyer operator, a class of FNNs is constructed which realize the simultaneous approximation of any smooth multivariate function and all its existing partial derivatives. We present, by making use of multivariate approximation tools, a quantitative upper bound estimation on approximation accuracy of the simultaneous approximation of the FNNs in terms of the modulus of smoothness of the functions to be approximated. The obtained results reveals that the approximation speed of the constructed FNNs depends not only on the number of hidden units used, but also on the smoothness of functions to be approximated. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper presents a review of some familiar methods of making roll schedule in cold rolling: coefficient law of experience, load distribution optimization, multi-load distribution optimization and slippage prevention optimization, as well as their application fields based on their characteristics. New comprehensive multi-load optimization has been used in many factories, so its core content and calculation is demonstrated. At the same time, a new rolling schedule method is brought forward in order to prevent slippage in strip rolling. Then some optimizing methods applied for roll schedule are presented. The method to combine equal multi-load optimization and artificial intelligence is already proved to be effective.

AB  - A new numerical calculation method has been developed based on the nonlinear analysis characteristics of artificial neural network (ANN). This method is a novel algorithm for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using the concept of the artificial intelligence. It is completely different from prior traditional numerical methods. It does not generate mesh in the calculation domain except for some random points, even does not solve the algebraic equations. This method has been applied to compute the vapor-water two-phase flows in a tube with uniform and nonuniform heating. Through the comparison of the calculated results between this method and theoretical analysis (the finite difference method), the validity of this meshfree method based on the ANN is confirmed. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Taking into account the efficiency of the rough set in incomplete information processing, the intuitiveness of querying and matching by case-based reasoning and the convenience of the ratio method, an approach based on multi-artificial intelligence methods for diagnosing transformer faults is proposed. By comprehensively considering the symptoms from DGA and electrical tests and analyzing large numbers of fault cases, a model for synthetic diagnosis based on the rough set, case-based reasoning and ratio method is developed. A three-layer structure has been constructed for this model to analyze the detailed fault of a transformer step by step. It is helpful to providing field personnel with effective advice even if the fault information may be incomplete. This model has such advantages as high speed of calculation, high correct rate, intuitional results, etc. Examples also show the effectiveness of the method.

AB  - RoboCup (the Robot World Cup) Simulation is used as a platform to study multi-agent competition and cooperation strategy in a complex environment. Firstly, the approach of opponent modeling is expounded, which takes corresponding strategy by analyzing the weakness of opponent. The approach enables the agents to make more effective independent decision and makes the actions highly pertinent and objective. Secondly, the information sharing among agents is analyzed. The cooperation among agents is improved by compressed coding and selective information sharing. Finally, local cooperating tactic problems are analyzed. The approach implements the local cooperation among agents through designing the tactic, and adjusts the tactic according to the change of the field condition. The approaches were applied to the China Robot Competition 2004 and gained the champion. That proves the method is efficient.

AB  - A class of adaptive ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms is presented to avoid the deficiency of typical ACO that often runs into local optimum. Global searching and convergence abilities are improved by adaptively changing the pheromone trails evaporation parameters. Some convergence properties for the algorithms are analyzed with the Markov process approach. Further more, an algorithm with guaranteed convergence to the optimal solution is developed. The simulation results for typical TSP problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are more effective than those for other modified ant systems.

AB  - Artificial immune system was investigated using the approaches of trusted computing and systematics, and the non-accurately-measurable limited computing model of immune computation was built. Besides, the model had three tiers, i. e. the innate immune tier, the adaptive immune tier and the parallel/distributed computing tier. In the immune computation, the features of the anomaly were matched through the query in the database, and the type of the anomaly was recognized. Furthermore, unknown anomaly was learnt through the rule matching of the anomaly, the features of new anomaly were memorized, and the features of the new anomaly were added to the database. In the model, the anomaly was eliminated by the destroyer, the clone and proliferating of the anomaly were restrained, and the two blades of the destroying mechanism in the immune computation were controlled. Moreover, the load balance of the immune computation was monitored, the robustness and security of the system were maintained, and the imperfection of the immunology theories was overcome. The experimental results show that the immune computation mechanism detects the anomalies such as worms and faults, recognizes their types, i. e. the love worms and their infected files, and eliminates the anomalies, so that the clone and proliferating of the anomalies are restrained, and the security and robustness of the system are insured.

AB  - The study of coal and gas outburst with multi-factor pattern recognition method is related to coal mining, safety engineering, geology engineering, geographic information system (GIS), probability theory, information science, and artificial intelligence (AI). Based on theoretical analysis and the relation among the factors that affect coal and gas outburst, the norm and model of pattern recognition are established. Then the design and algorithm of pattern recognition system are completed, on which the probability prediction norms are certain and the development of coal and gas outburst prediction system is completed. With eight factors including active fault, maximal stress, gas pressure, and gas content acting as the main discriminant, the pattern recognition method was used to perform possibility prediction of coal outburst; and the mining area was then divided into coal and gas outburst dangerous area, threaten area and safe area, respectively, to assess and predict the danger of coal and gas outburst. Thus the accuracy of coal and gas outburst prediction is improved. By the method, a comparatively scientific region prediction of coal and gas outburst are built; and it is possible to judge and precontrol the coal and gas outburst.

AB  - A new method to fast trace power network topology in which the graph theory is integrated with artificial search technique is proposed. In this method the node-breaker incidence matrix is used to express the topology inside the substation and through deducing node-breaker incidence matrix the node adjacent matrix expressing the connectivity among nodes is obtained and a node tree is constructed to represent the connection of network nodes. Under real-time continuous operation situation when switching event of circuit breaker occurs, the proposed method can rapidly trace the topology change within the substation by modifying the node adjacent matrix and the nodes inside the substation are anew grouped and mapped as the nodes of power network, then using heuristic search algorithm the former search tree are locally updated, thus the rapid tracking of local power network where the topology is changed is implemented. The test results of an actual power network show that the proposed method possesses versatility and real-time performance and can meet the need of real-time topological analysis of power network.

AB  - Distributed cognition theory plays a role of instructor in Human-Computer Interaction research by coordinating interaction between human and computer and combining advantages of them. Though Resources Model based on distributed cognition theory has been successfully employed for analyzing human computer interaction, the model, to some extent, leads to confusion in the representative forms because of the absence of support to complex user tasks and correct definitions of elements. Therefore, an extended resources model (ERM) is constructed by using distributed cognition theory to connect actions with representations in Human-Computer Interaction and to guide the design and realization of interfaces. The Extended Resources Model supports actions with static constructions and interactive strategies so as to decrease human cognitive burdens of interaction. This work will be beneficial to designing interfaces according to human's cognitive characteristics.

AB  - Haplotypes, rather than genotypes are required in some disease susceptibilities and drug response tests. However, it is both time-consuming and expensive to obtain haplotypes experimentally. Therefore usually genotype data are collected in the laboratory at first, then, haplotype data are inferred from them resorting to some computational approaches. Different from Clark's well-known haplotype inference method, Gusfield and Wang et al. proposed a new model according to the maximum parsimony principle. It tries to find a minimum set of haplotypes that can explain the genotype samples. This parsimony model overcomes some weaknesses of Clark's method. For the parsimony this paper presents model a polynomial time greedy algorithm and a compound algorithm that combines the greedy policy with the branch-and-bound strategy in a uniform framework. Compared with the original complete algorithm proposed by Wang et al., the greedy approximation algorithm runs much faster, and in the meanwhile, produces relatively higher accurate results. The compound algorithm is also a complete algorithm. Simulation results show that it is much more efficient and can be applied to instances of much larger scales than the original complete algorithm.

AB  - In the framework of axiomatic fuzzy sets theory, we first study how to impersonally and automatically determine the membership functions for fuzzy sets according to original data and facts, and a new algorithmic framework of determining membership functions and their logic operations for fuzzy sets has been proposed. Then, we apply the proposed algorithmic framework to give a new clustering algorithm and show that the algorithm is feasible. A number of illustrative examples show that this approach offers a far more flexible and effective means for the intelligent systems in real-world applications. Compared with popular fuzzy clustering algorithms, such as c-means fuzzy algorithm and k-nearest-neighbor fuzzy algorithm, the new fuzzy clustering algorithm is more simple and understandable, the data types of the attributes can be various data types or subpreference relations, even descriptions of human intuition, and the distance function and the class number need not be given beforehand. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - The Kernel method is an effective and popular trick in machine learning. In this paper, by introducing it into conventional auto-associative memory models (AMs), we construct a unified framework of kernel auto-associative memory models (KAMs), which makes the existing exponential and polynomial AMs become its special cases. Further, in order to reduce KAM's connect complexity, inspired by "small-world network" recently described by Watts and Strogatz, we propose another unified framework of small-world structure (SWS) inspired kernel auto-associative memory models (SWSI-KAMs), which, in principle, makes KAMs simpler in structure. Simulation results on the FERET face database show that, the SWSI-KAMs adopting kernels such as Exponential and Hyperbolic tangent kernels have advantages of configuration simplicity while their recognition performance is almost as good as or even better than corresponding KAMs with full connectivity. In the end, the SWSI-KAM adopting Exponential kernel with different connectivities was emphatically investigated for robustness based on those face images which were added random noises and/or partially occluded in a mosaic way, and the experiments demonstrate that the SWSI-KAM with Exponential kernel is more robust in all cases of network connectivity of 20%, 40% and 60% than both PCA and recently proposed (PC)2A algorithms for face recognition. © 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel approach on trying to get feasible and effective methods to let computer simulate human to do analysis and inference by constructing a model and system for Competitive Intelligence (CI) analysis. We have studied how to realize classical management strategic analysis method SWOT (acronym of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) in competitive intelligence, and to get relevant strategic decisions from natural language described information. We use a genetic neural network model to reach global optimizations for the strategies set of unclear structured knowledge. And design and realize a prototype system for SWOT analysis in CI. The system makes uncertain reasoning, then automatically produces SWOT analysis report in a document of WORD for reference strategic suggestions. The system can learn and accumulate experience from successful cases like human experts. The neural network model is robustness and can be adjusted partially or entirely by re-training. Furthermore, the system is simple, easy to use and fast in analysis. It provides references for some similar researches in other decision fields.

AB  - Oil monitoring is referred to as wear particle debris analysis and physical analysis of lubricants' properties. Information technology, such as database technology, image processing, expert system, data fusion and multi-agent system theories, etc. makes oil-monitoring procedures more intelligent. This paper introduces the development of some information systems such as management database, computer-aided wear particle analysis software used in oil monitoring. The basic principles and models of information technologies used in this field are presented. The development of IT as an integral element of an oil analysis-based condition monitoring system has been carried out in the authors' laboratory since 1986. Initially, the principal application of IT was to improve the data management and processing procedures. The second use of IT was in the development of a wear particle image processing system. The third aspect of utilizing IT is artificial intelligence. Finally, the application of IT-based network techniques is implemented. The progress in the application of IT in the authors' laboratory shows that the combination of information technology and oil monitoring can increase the speed of oil analysis, manage the information conveniently and obtain analysis conclusion more precisely in relation to practical application. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Focusing on the problems existed in some blind equalization genetic algorithms that good astringency and converge to optimal solution are hard to achieve, this paper takes the complementary projection operator of a received date matrix as annihilator of a transmitted sequence vector to be detected, and then formulates the blind detection problem into a quadratic optimization with integral constraints. A novel direct blind equalization based on genetic algorithms is proposed. The character of this algorithm is that the fitness function is formatted with the transmitted sequences, the encoding space is identical to the genetic space, and the searching space is discrete and finite. Simulations show that the algorithm achieves good astringency and satisfactory performance.

AB  - Although the sequence information on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) continues to grow, many GPCRs remain orphaned (i.e. ligand specificity unknown) or poorly characterized with little structural information available, so an automated and reliable method is badly needed to facilitate the identification of novel receptors. In this study, a method of fast Fourier transform-based support vector machine has been developed for predicting GPCR subfamilies according to protein's hydrophobicity. In classifying Class B, C, D and F subfamilies, the method achieved an overall Matthew's correlation coefficient and accuracy of 0.95 and 93.3%, respectively, when evaluated using the jackknife test. The method achieved an accuracy of 100% on the Class B independent dataset. The results show that this method can classify GPCR subfamilies as well as their functional classification with high accuracy. A web server implementing the prediction is available at http://chem.scu.edu.cn/blast/Pred- GPCR. © Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS.

AB  - Diagnostic ultrasound is a useful and noninvasive method in clinical medicine. Although due to its qualitative, subjective and experience-based nature, ultrasound image interpretation can be influenced by image conditions such as scanning frequency and machine settings. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to extract the liver features using the joint features of fractal dimension and the entropies of texture edge co-occurrence matrix based on ultrasound images, which is not sensitive to changes in emission frequency and gain. Then, Fisher linear classifier and support vector machine are employed to test a group of 99 in-vivo liver fibrosis images from 18 patients, as well as other 273 liver images from 18 normal human volunteers.

AB  - How to effectively generate detectors is one of the important problems of negative selection algorithm and its practicability. A new algorithm which adaptively generates detectors is proposed. This algorithm can regulate current detector set according to actual circumstances, and quickly detect abnormal changes in a very large non-self space by using a small detector set. This algorithm has a good generality to some degree in a number of anomaly detection applications. Its theoretical foundation is analyzed. An experimental example and results are given to prove that this algorithm is effective.

To verify the effectiveness of this approach, a test has been run on the dataset consisting of 1000 customers in 3 consecutive months. The result is compared with the real dataset in the fourth month consisting of 162 customers, which has been set as the customers for recognition. The high correct rate of the test (96.30%), together with 1.87% of the judge-by-mistake rate and 7.82% of the leaving-out rate, demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach.

AB  - Tool wear has long been identified as the most undesirable characteristic of the machining operation. Flank wear is particular directly affects the workpiece dimensions and the surface quality. A reliable and sensitive technique for monitoring the tool wear without interrupting the process, is crucial in realization of modern and flexible manufacturing system. In this work, intelligent prediction of tool wear model based on neural network is established. The collected cutting force signals were pre-processed to extract the feature elements for the purpose of effectively predicting the tool wear condition. After the training process is finished, the neural network becomes a knowledge-based tool wear system and estimates the tool wear. Results showed the ability of the neural network to accurately predict the flank wear. The prediction model will be used in the CNC (computerized numerical control) turning physic simulation system and tool wear state will be displayed vividly using virtual reality technology.

AB  - Methods such as numerical simulation and experience function imitated and so on were adopted to study on time-space effect of deep foundation pit. Because of complexity in influence factors and difficulty in measure of various factors, normal analysis methods were not strong in adaptability. At present, only time or space effect was considered in analysis of time-space effect, and analysis method of time-space effect considered simultaneously based on artificial intelligence was not established. It is shown that high non-linear complex problems can be solved easily by artificial neural network as well as the method of ANN (artificial neural network) based on GA (genetic arithmetic) has optimizing function in the whole field of solution. The structure and weight value of the network are optimized in-phrase in GA-ANN model, and the weight value of the network and influence factors of problem are two kinds of different qualities. When the two kinds of variables are regarded as input variables to train the network, it may lead to chaos of the network, thus it will decrease identification precision of the network. The model of time-space effect on deep foundation pit is established that the structure and weight value of the network can be optimized by stages with GA based on labor of influence factors. The comparative analysis with the BP (back propagation) model and the GA-ANN model optimized in-phrase shows the model optimized by stages can improve identification precision and analysis efficiency of the network, thus it will be closer to the fact.

AB  - In this paper, a novel lifting integer wavelet transform based on difference correlation structure (DCCS-LIWT) is proposed. First, we establish a relationship between the performance of a linear predictor and the difference correlations of an image. The obtained results provide a theoretical foundation for the following construction of the optimal lifting filters. Then, the optimal prediction lifting coefficients in the sense of least-square prediction error are derived. DCCS-LIWT puts heavy emphasis on image inherent dependence. A distinct feature of this method is the use of the variance-normalized autocorrelation function of the difference image to construct a linear predictor and adapt the predictor to varying image sources. The proposed scheme also allows respective calculations of the lifting filters for the horizontal and vertical orientations. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method produces better results than the other well-known integer transforms for the lossless image compression. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - In order to develop a patent tissue-engineered blood vessel that grossly resembles native tissue, required culture times in most studies exceed 8 weeks. For the sake of shortening the maturation period of the constructs, we have used deformation as the basic index for mechanical environment control. A new bioreactor with a machine vision identifier was developed to accurately control the deformation of the construct during the perfusion process. Two groups of seeded constructs (n = 4 per group) were investigated in this study, with one group stimulated by a cyclic deformation of 10% and the other by a pulsatile pressure that gradually increased to 120 mm Hg (the control group). After 21 days of culture, the mechanical properties of the constructs were examined. The average burst strength and suture retention strength in the two groups were significantly different (t test, p < 0.05). For the experimental group, the average burst strength and suture retention strength were higher than those of the control group, by 31.6 and 23.4%, respectively. Specifically, the average burst strength of the constructs reached 1,402 mm Hg (close to that of the native vessel, i.e. 1,680 mm Hg) within a relatively short period of 21 days. In conclusion, deformation is an observable, controllable and very valuable index for mechanical environment control in vascular tissue engineering. It makes the control of mechanical stimuli more essential and experiments more comparable. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG.

AB  - At present, the electricity market of China is a unilateral market excluding retail market. This kind of market with fixed load demand is imperfect. The power companies may use the market power to manipulate the market price and earn more profits. However, the exorbitant price of the generation market may lead to the bankruptcy of power companies and the breakdown of the whole electricity market. Based on the theory of social welfare of economics, a price control model is proposed to apply to this unilateral electricity market to control the electricity price, and insure the stable and highly efficiently running of the electricity market. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model, an artificial intelligence method is adopted to simulate the operation of the market based on the evolutionary game and cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed price control model is effective.

AB  - A displacement back analysis is proposed by combining the support vector machine and simulated annealing. Firstly the support vector machine is used to substitute the time-consuming finite element analysis; and secondly simulated annealing is used for the optimization of objective function for fear that the search often falls in one of the minimums and cannot go any further when the conventional mathematical optimization methods are employed. The feasibility of this approach is verified by back analysis of the mechanical parameters of a slope.

AB  - An improved PSO algorithm was presented and applied to optimal the PID gains tuning of hydraulic turbogenerators speed governor. The ITAE criterion of hydraulic turbogenerators speed errors was taken as the fitness function of the improved PSO algorithm. The digital simulation results performed on an actual hydropower plant in China indicate that the PID control law optimised by the improved PSO algorithm can effectively improve the dynamic performance of hydraulic transients with fast response and strong robustness especially on isolated operation conditions.

AB  - Machine learning is an eternal problem in the researches of artificial intelligence. However, machine learning methods are short of systemic theoretic foundation at present and some preferable ones such as statistic learning theory are exploring ones. Therefore, this paper researches machine learning by Lie group which has good mathematics configuration advances some basic conceptions of Lie group machine learning (LML) and conceptions of learning based on dual space, and formed the basic learning theory framework based on Lie group. The theory framework can describe machine learning system by algebra and geometry methods. So that it makes a fine configuration for describing the procession of machine learning and makes up for the lack of other theories of machine learning. It can be believed that the researches of machine learning could be profoundly influenced by these works.

AB  - During the past over 30 years, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) has been attracted a special attention in artificial intelligence (AI) area. However, the intelligence and collaboration of ITS will not always be very perfect. With the emergency of agent technology, many researchers have rebuilt the confidence in ITS research. And many achievements have been made in recent years. This paper designs a collaborative ITS model using agent technology called ACITS (Note: here we will use ACITS as the abbreviation of the model name). Then it introduces this model in detail, including architecture, working process of ACITS, as well as the collaboration of student agents in ACITS. It might benefit for improving the collaboration and intelligence of ITS.

AB  - As a suitable tool for analyzing concept interconnection formally, the theory of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is applied. FCA deals with formal mathematical tools and techniques to develop and analyze relationship between concepts and to develop concept structures, and concepts are important building blocks in the concept-interconnection. This paper mainly discusses how FCA can be used to support concept-interconnection analysis from an application point of view. In order to introduce our idea, two kinds of concept-interconnection and interconnection measure in detail are discussed. One is based on Concept-Backbone and the other is based on the attributes. It is seen that FCA can support the building of concept-interconnection as a learning technique, but the established concept-interconnection also can be analyzed by using techniques of FCA.

AB  - Immune algorithm is an intelligent system, and shows great potential in optimization. However, as the local search of immune optimizer is of some blindness, its efficiency is limited. Guiding immune optimization algorithm is proposed, which introduces sociality to immune optimization algorithm, and accordingly improves convergence speed. The related parameters are also discussed. Analysis and simulation results show that guiding immune optimizer effectively improves the searching speed of immune algorithm as well as ensures the high succeed probability.

AB  - An improved approach based on support vector machine (SVM) called the center distance ratio method is presented for license plate character recognition. First the support vectors are pre-extracted. A minimal set called the margin vector set, which contains all support vectors, is extracted. These margin vectors compose new training data and construct the classifier by using the general SVM optimized. The experimental results show that the improved SVM method does well at correct rate and training speed.

AB  - This paper aims at exploring the possibility of building a dynamic model by artificial neural network for the wastewater treatment process in the paper making by waste paper. During the investigation, the error BP (Back Prorogation) neural network is used to establish a dynamic model and describe the complex relationship among the COD of the influent wastewater, the dosage of the added medicament, the flowrate of the influent, the historical COD of the effluent and the predictive COD of the effluent. Different training methods for the network are then compared and discussed, demonstrating that the training method with dynamic adjustment results in good consistency between the calculated outputs and the practical outputs. The proposed model is finally applied to the wastewater treatment of a paper mill, with the results verifying the effectiveness of the BP model for the dynamic description of wastewater treatment. This model lays a foundation for the further investigation into the on-line intelligent control of the wastewater treatment system.

AB  - The goal of model selection is to identity the model that generated the data. Goodness of a model is measured using generalizability, which takes two opposite aspects: goodness of fit and model complexity into account, we use generalized KL-divergence defined on the manifold to measure the goodness of fit, and use the conception of curvature from the point of view of differential geometry to explore the intrinsic model complexity that is free of reparametrization; through theoretical analysis, we proved the future residual that is qualified to measure the generalizabihty can be expressed by using the intrinsic curvature array of model, from which we propose a new model selection criterion KL-divergence and curvature information criterion with very clear and intuitive geometric understanding of model selection. Experimental results reveal its validity.

AB  - Aimed at the automatic music creation in computer music field, a method was proposed to model, analyze, generate and synthesize basic elements of music relationship individually. On the basis of the formalizable characteristic of music rhythm, a probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) system was defined to describe the relatively independent music rhythm elements. Existing music articles were analyzed and the music rhythm was transformed into a set of formalized expressions by the PCFG system. The presence probability of each grammar expression in the system was calculated by using the inside-outside algorithm, and then the prototype system was implemented by adopting PCFG to generate new music rhythms automatically. The results indicate that the music rhythms generated by the proposed method have styles similar to those of the sample music.

AB  - Aimed at particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm being easily trapped into local minima value in multimodal function, a rotating surface transformation (RST) method was proposed. The optimal function was mapped onto the homeomorphism surface by RST method, and the current local minima point was transformed into the global maximum point without changing the optimal function values under current local minima point. When PSO was trapped into local minima point, proper transforming parameters were selected according to concrete optimal function, and the global optimum resolution was realized by executing RST. Four benchmark functions were tested using this method. Experimental results show that compared with two conventional PSO at the same iterations for high dimension function, the proposed method converges faster and is more stable.

AB  - A service interaction management system framework was proposed based on analyzing the similarity of biological immune system and service interaction detection. In this framework, the trigger event was mapped to the antigen; the output of service logic response to trigger event was mapped to immune response; service interaction was mapped to abnormal immune response; and the resolution of service interaction was mapped to immune adjust. Through these mapping rules, different service interaction detections and resolutions are no longer isolated, but can be integrated.

AB  - A formal criterion to verify the validity of sequential clustering algorithms is presented. Based on the criterion, DBSCANJZPoll, an algorithmic variation of DBSCAN clustering algorithm, is proposed. DBSCANJZPoll performs an order-dependent clustering sub-procedure a few times with random processing order, and determines the last clustering results by means of a simple statistical principle, which is derived from the above formal criterion. Simulation results show that in the case of noisy data, the clustering precision of DBSCANJZPoll is superior to DBSCAN algorithm. Moreover, theoretical analysis indicates that, for high dimensionality data, the time complexity of DBSCANJZPoll is asymptotical to O(N), which is superior to other algorithms in DBSCAN family. The simulation of low dimensionality data shows superior time efficiency of DBSCANJZPoll.

AB  - Based on the principles of the immune system, a new method of fault diagnosis for asynchronous motor is presented. The improved negative selection algorithm (INSA) is proposed to overcome NSA's disadvantage of indistinguishable fault kind, which is coded by real number and concluded matching by Euclid Distance (ED). Using restrained action between high affinity antibodies in biology immune system for reference, affinity between candidate detectors and memory detectors is computed to restrain the higher affinity antibodies based on INSA. Based on the experiment results of motor stator turn-to-turn short-circuit, that outcomes and load have linear relations in certain area is proposed after the fundamental component of shorted load current is transformed by time-to-frequency. The INSA is applied in checking turn-to-turn short-circuit. The INSA is proved to overcome the conventional negative selection algorithm's shortcomings of poor learning ability and undiscriminating between fault kind, be exactness and validity by experimental results.

AB  - Various process parameters exert different effects in stamping process. In order to study the relationships among the process parameters of box stamping process, including the blank holder force, friction coefficient, depth of drawbead, offset and length of drawbead, the decision tree algorithm C4.5 was performed to generate the decision tree using the result data of the box stamping simulation. The design and improvement methods of the decision tree were presented. Potential and valuable rules were generated by traversing the decision tree, which plays an instructive role on the practical design. The rules show that the correct combination of blank holder force and setting of drawbead are the dominant contribution for controlling the cracking and wrinkling in box stamping process. In order to validate the rules, the stamping process for box was also performed. The experiment results show good agreement with the generated rules.

AB  - Representation and decomposition of complex decision-making tasks are bottleneck problem of complex task decision. This paper uses multi-agent technology to construct an agent organization-based distributed intelligence decision support system (AOBDIDSS) structure model, applies generalized decision function (GDF) to the decomposition of decision task specifications, and determines decomposition criteria and properties of decision task specifications based on GDF. Because the task decomposition based on GDF is equivalent to the decomposition of Bayesian network, we present the representation and decomposition methods of decision tasks and properties based on Bayesian network. On these bases, the decision task decomposition problems can be entailed basically to construct a multi-sectioned Bayesian network and sub-Bayesian networks related to decision task specifications. The method is used to analyze the representation and decomposition of decision tasks in medical diagnosis. The results show that the model and method is not only feasible, but also effective and novel.

AB  - In the enzymatic membrane reactor for separating casein hydrolysate, backflushing technology has been used to decrease the fouling of the membrane. Predication of the backflushing efficiency poses a complex non-linear problem as the system integrates enzymatic hydrolysis, membrane separation and periodic backflushing together. In this paper an alternative artificial neural network approach is developed to predict the backflushing efficiency as a function of duration and interval. A contour plot of backflushing performance is presented to model these effects, and the backflushing conditions have been optimized as duration of 10 s and interval of 10 min using this neural network. Also, simple neural networks are established to predict the time evolution of flux before and after backflushing. The results predicted by the models are in good agreement with the experimental data, and the average deviations for all the cases are well within ±5%. The neural network approach is found to be capable of modeling the backflushing with confidence.

AB  - As a new type of learning machine developed on the basis of statistics learning theory, support vector machine (SVM) plays an important role in knowledge discovering and knowledge updating by constructing non-linear optimal classifier. However, realizing SVM requires resolving quadratic programming under constraints of inequality, which results in calculation difficulty while learning samples gets larger. Besides, standard SVM is incapable of tackling multi-classification. To overcome the bottleneck of populating SVM, with training algorithm presented, the problem of quadratic programming is converted into that of resolving a linear system of equations composed of a group of equation constraints by adopting the least square SVM (LS-SVM) and introducing a modifying variable which can change inequality constraints into equation constraints, which simplifies the calculation. With regard to multi-classification, an LS-SVM applicable in multi-classification is deduced. Finally, efficiency of the algorithm is checked by using universal Circle in square and two-spirals to measure the performance of the classifier.

AB  - Computing the diagnosis action sequence with minimum cost is a NP-Complete problem if diagnosis actions are dependent. Some algorithms have been proposed, but the problem descriptions are not accurate enough and the diagnosis cost is not optimized enough. The problem is precisely defined in this paper and an algorithm named NGAMECD (Niche Genetic Algorithm for Minimum Expected Cost of Diagnosis) is proposed. It is proved that NGAMECD can avoid running out of memory by forecasting computing space. It can obtain better implicit parallelism than normal genetic algorithm, which makes the algorithm more applicable to the grid environments. Furthermore, the algorithm is able to hold population diversity and avoid premature problem. Compared with the updated P/C algorithm, diagnosis cost with NGAMECD is decreased about 20%-50%.

AB  - As a new unsupervised learning technique, manifold learning has captured the attention of many researchers in the field of machine learning and cognitive sciences. The major algorithms include Isometric mapping (ISOMAP) and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). The approaches can be used for discovering the intrinsic dimensions of nonlinear high-dimensional data effectively and aim researchers to analyze the data better. How to quantitatively analyze the relationship between the intrinsic dimensions and the observation space, however, has fewer reports. And thus further works in manifold learning may have suffered some difficulties. The paper focuses on two kinds of manifold learning algorithms (ISOMAP, LLE), and discusses magnification factors and principal spread directions from the observation space to the intrinsic low-dimensional space. Also the corresponding algorithm is proposed. Experiments show the effectiveness and advantages of the research.

AB  - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is generic heuristic algorithm based on swarm intelligence. It has been applied to many practical continuous optimization problems. However, due to the limitation of its velocity-displacement search model, it could not be extended to solve discrete and combinatorial optimization problems effectively. To solve this problem, this paper first reviews the applications of PSO algorithm in integer programming problems and its binary version discrete model, in which their corresponding limitations are analyzed. Then based on traditional velocity-displacement operator, mechanism of PSO algorithm is studied and general particle swarm optimization (GPSO) model is proposed. Thus, PSO algorithm developed on this general model can be naturally extended to solve discrete and combinatorial optimization problems. GPSO model is still based on PSO mechanism, but the updating operator could integrate with other solutions such as GA, simulated annealing and taboo search easily. Travel salesman problem (TSP) is used to demonstrate this extension. In view of the success of GA in this problem, this paper uses genetic operator as the updating operator in GPSO model and further proposes genetic operator based PSO model, and selects Inver over operator as the genetic operator in this model. Finally the corresponding PSO algorithm for TSP is presented. In contrast to the GA with the same genetic operator, GPSO based algorithm converges consistently with better TSP solutions and saves computational cost significantly.

AB  - Inference problems are one of the main research topics in the artificial intellect field. So far there have been various inference systems, some of them have been applied in fuzzy control according to their feature. In 1989, the concept of truth-valued flow inference was introduced by Wang1, and its mathematical theory of truth-valued flow inference was set up by Wang 2 in 1995. In this paper, aimed at the real meaning of the truth-valued in the truth-valued flow inference, we introduce the concepts of the inner product truth-valued and inner product truth-valued flow inference, and analyze some inference algorithms of fuzzy control at present in detail. We reveal that the fuzzy inference algorithms in fuzzy control at present are all regarded as inner product truth-valued flow inference algorithm. Finally, inner product truth-valued flow inference approach is generalized in the multiple inputs and single output. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Tissue engineers are often confused on finding the most successful strategy for specific patient. In this study, we used artificial neural networks to predict the outcomes of different vascular tissue engineering strategies, thus providing advisory information for experimental designers. Over 30 variables were used as features of the tissue engineering strategies. Different architectures of artificial neural networks with back propagation algorithm were tested to obtain the best model configuration for the prediction of the tissue engineering strategies. In the computational experiments, the artificial neural networks with one and two hidden layers could, respectively, detect unsuccessful strategies with the highest predictive accuracy of 91.45 and 94.24%. In conclusion, artificial intelligence has great potential in tissue engineering decision support. It can provide accurate advisory information for tissue engineers, thus reducing failures and improving therapeutic effects. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - When performing visualization and classification, people often confront the problem of dimensionality reduction. Isomap is one of the most promising nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. However, when Isomap is applied to real-world data, it shows some limitations, such as being sensitive to noise. In this paper, an improved version of Isomap, namely S-Isomap, is proposed. S-Isomap utilizes class information to guide the procedure of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Such a kind of procedure is called supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In S-Isomap, the neighborhood graph of the input data is constructed according to a certain kind of dissimilarity between data points, which is specially designed to integrate the class information. The dissimilarity has several good properties which help to discover the true neighborhood of the data and, thus, makes S-Isomap a robust technique for both visualization and classification, especially for real-world problems. In the visualization experiments, S-Isomap is compared with Isomap, LLE, and WeightedIso. The results show that S-Isomap performs the best. In the classification experiments, S-Isomap is used as a preprocess of classification and compared with Isomap, WeightedIso, as well as some other well-established classification methods, including the K-nearest neighbor classifier, BP neural network, J4.8 decision tree, and SVM. The results reveal that S-Isomap excels compared to Isomap and WeightedIso in classification, and it is highly competitive with those well-known classification methods. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a genetics-based approach for solving conceptual design problems in dealing with functional relation changes. A functional representation model based on verb-attributes is proposed to supply computers with sufficient functional information needed in principle conceptual design. Using bio-genetics as a blueprint, a concept of product gene is proposed, which is employed to index principle solutions (PSs), and therefore bridges the gap between relation change-based functions (RCFs) and their corresponding PSs. A knowledge base is built by extracting product genes from existing PSs by means of reverse transcription and translation. An illustrative design example has been provided to show the capability and effectiveness of the developed, genetics-based principle conceptual design platform (GPCDP). © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2005.
