AB  - After an overview of the cellular logic image processor, CLIP 3, parallel algorithms for joining two points are described. These real time algorithms are simple, work properly, preserve the connectivity, are based only on logic, and show much of the behavior of processing occurring in sensory elements of animals.

AB  - Parallel image processing shows certain general similarities to retinal processing and shares with optical computing the characteristics of parallelism. Simulation on digital serial computers (DSC‘s), although possible in the simpler cases, very soon becomes almost uncontrollable, requiring large memories and very long programming and execution times. Advances in present circuit technology now permit one to construct large arrays of interconnected parallel logic elements resulting in real-time parallel machines where the action of a statement is simultaneous on all the points of the array. A typical processor of this kind is briefly described and an introduction to its code is given. Examples of symmetrical and directional functions and parallel algorithms are also presented. Possible applications of such processors in image processing, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence are briefly discussed.

AB  - The general properties of human speech are discussed as a first step in studying the most important characteristics to be incorporated by a language expert system. It is proposed that man has different types of speech ranging between literary and specialized proses. The general rules for each of these limiting uses are outlined, treating language in the context of information theory and using fuzzy set theory as the basic tool. It is concluded that specialized speech is the most common use of human language; thus its rules have to be the guidelines for development of any language expert system. Some of the basic characteristics of such a system are presented and discussed. © 1985.

AB  - Ensuring the daily movement of millions of passengers and tons of goods in the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro is a complex task that involves several transportation modes; federal, state, and local agencies; public and private operators; and skilled personnel. Very often parts of the system become ineffective. Coordination among agencies and operators is almost nonexistent, but they work together when a critical situation arises. Another problem that has been addressed and that requires similar treatment is evacuation in the event of a nuclear disaster at the nuclear power plant in the state of Rio de Janeiro. For these numerous ill-structured problems, in which human behavior, social and political considerations, and multiobjective decision making are involved, the potential of expert systems technology was considered and is included in the contingency transportation planning.

AB  - Possible errors in earlier methods of coding structures are discussed, particularly with regard to α- and β-conformation and double bonds. The proposed method of coding is based on the absolute interatomic distances and the relative orientations of atoms. The coding system agrees with previous theoretical equations, except for density matrices; the usual classification of α, β and δ effects is obviously not included. An advantage of the method is that neighbouring atoms which have negligible effect are not included in the coding, so that the number of plausible structures is reduced. Another advantage is that similar structures can be tested, atom by atom, to a level at which complete structural equivalence no longer exists. The program developed on this basis is applicable with personal computers and provides options which enable the theoretical spectrum to be predicted, the signals to be interpreted if the experimental spectrum is known, and the influence of each neighbouring atom on the carbon signal to be studied. © 1989.

AB  - Service restoration, system reconfiguration, and other related problems are formulated and solved by heuristic search, which is a search strategy (e.g. depth-first search) armed with practical rules (say, based on operator experience) to guide the search. The proposed framework allows designing algorithms to solve a wide range of distribution restoration problems. System operator procedures can be accommodated as part of the search process. Test results are presented. An illustrative example is given in the Appendix. © 1989 IEEE

AB  - Neural networks, or connectionist systems, have recently emerged as a powerful model of collective, parallel computation of great interest in artificial intelligence and combinatorial optimization. The understanding of neural networks is still largely dependent upon simulations, which in turn can be of great interest to the designer of parallel software, owing to the inherently distributed character of those systems. This paper is concerned with the simulation of one specific class of neural networks, namely those introduced by J. J. Hopfield. We discuss the design and occam implementation of a distributed parallel simulator of such networks, allowing for both binary‐ and continuous‐response neurons. A design is provided which we judge to be generic to a large extent, and then problems related to an occam implementation are discussed. One problem of particular relevance is the potential occurrence of communication deadlocks as a result of the unbuffered communication among occam processes. Copyright © 1990 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - In this article, the problem of decision making in a prototypical complex decision environment is cast into the conceptual framework of large-scale systemstheory. The problem of the lead decision maker within a decision team is described and an operational model is given. It is pointed out that this primarily real intelligence-only decision team is both knowlegable and adaptive, but not as reliable as might be required under conditions of high cognitive loading. An artificial intelligence-based decision components, the "trusted assistant",is the proposed as a means of achieving a more effective intelligence balance within the system. The primarily structural features of this personal expert system are presented and considerations involved in incorporating it into present-day large-scale decision systems are discussed. It is shown that in many instances this trusted assistant can play a distinctly novel and vital role in the decision making process. © 1991.

AB  - This article clarifies some concepts of artificial intelligence (AI), discusses some of its applications, and demonstrates its potential application in the petroleum industry. AI is divided into two levels: the psychological, where it attempts to represent knowledge explicity, and the intuitive, where explication of knowledge is not important and the emphasis is on brain architecture. Expert systems, which implement explicit knowledge, are discussed in more detail. A brief discussion of use of AI in Brazil, particularly at Petrobras, is presented.

AB  - This work describes the utilization of two groups of programs in searching for characteristic signals of NMR 13C of steroidal compounds. The first group of programs used data bases with the spectral data and a methodology that enables the choice and the search of substructures. The chemical shifts and multiplicities for each specific substructure are used as rules to identify different types and subtypes of steroidal compounds. The second one was built to apply the rules formulated by the first group of programs and to foresee any skeletal based on a spectral analysis.

AB  - A modularization discipline for database schemas is first described. The dicipline incorporates both a strategy for enforcing integrity constraints and a tactic for organizing large sets of database structures, integrity constraints, and operations. A software tool that helps the development and maintenance of database schemas modularized according to the discipline is then presented. It offers a user-friendly interface that guides the designer through the various stages of the creation of a new module or through the process of changing objects of existing modules. The tool incorporates, in a declarative style, a description of the design and redesign rules behind the modularization discipline, hence facilitating the incremental addition of new expertise about database design. © 1991, ACM.

AB  - The present paper introduce a new model of fuzzy neuron, one which increases the computational power of the aruncial neuron, turning it also into a symbolic processing device. This model proposes the synapsis to be symbolically and numerically defined, by means of the assignment of tokens to the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The matching or concatenation compatibility between these tokens is used to decided about the possible connections among neurons of a given net. The strength of the compatible synapsis is made dependent on the amount of the available presynaptic and post synaptic tokens. The symbolic and numeric processing capacity of the new fuzzy neuron is used here to build a neural net (JARGON) to disclose the existing knowledge in natural language data bases such as medical files, set of interviews, and reports about engineering operations. © 1992 IEEE

AB  - The problem of generating guillotine cutting patterns for a rectangular plate is studied and a type of structure is proposed for representing the solution of the problem, called and-or graph, which is commonly used in the Artificial Intelligence environment. To search the graph we combined two classical strategies: depth-first and hill-climbing. Further, some heuristics are considered and computational results are presented, relating their performance on examples from both literature as well as randomly generated. © 1992.

AB  - An emergent alternative to the conventional artificial intelligence approach, the artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to the identification of Mössbauer spectral patterns. The advantages of this approach are the robustness and the generalization capability. In this paper we utilize the counterpropagation architecture of ANN with an unsupervised training algorithm. This kind of training only needs a data set with samples of the patterns to be recognized and the ANN itself extracts statistical information to organize the similar patterns into convenient classes. To increase the training performance, the Mössbauer spectra are first preprocessed and then applied to the ANN. The results obtained with a 0.3% fluctuation training data set of five different patterns and a 1.0% fluctuation test set of the same patterns reveal a very good recognition rate for a few training sessions. The ANN synapses after training can be interpreted as a Mössbauer spectrum that is the average of the training spectra of the same class. As the number of training sessions increases, this internal representation exhibits a fluctuation that tends to zero. The results encourage us to incorporate an ANN that performs the spectral pattern recognition task into Mössbauer data acquisition equipment. © 1993.

AB  - Neural network computing is one of the fastest growing fields of artificial intelligence due to its ability to “learn” nonlinear relationships. This article presents the approach of back propagation neural networks for modeling of free radical polymerization in high pressure tubular reactors. Industrial data were used to train the network for prediction of the temperature profile along the reactor, as well as polymer properties such as density, melt flow index, and molecular weight averages. Comparisons were made between the neural network and mechanistic model predictions published in the literature. Results showed the promising capability of a neural network as an alternative approach to model polymeric systems. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Copyright © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - The paper proposes a new model of Petri nets based on the use of logic based neurons. In contrast to the existing generalizations, this approach is aimed at neural-type modeling of the entire concept with a full exploitation of the learning capabilities of the processing units being used there. The places and transitions of the net are represented by OR and AND-type and DOMINANCE neurons, respectively. A correspondence between this model and the previous two-valued counterpart is also revealed. The learning aspects associated with the nets are investigated. © 1994 IEEE

AB  - One of the products of engineering, besides constructed artifacts, is design documentation. To understand how design participants use documentation, designers and typical documentation users were interviewed and protocols were taken of them both creating and using design documentation. The protocols were taken from realistic projects of preliminary design for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVAC). The studies of document creation and use revealed three important issues: (1) design participants not only look up design facts; they frequently access documents to obtain information about the rationale for design decisions; (2) the design rationale that they see often is missing from the documents; and (3) design requirements change frequently over a project life cycle so that design documents are often inconsistent and out of date. Recognizing these documentation issues in design practice, a new approach was developed in which documents are no longer static records, but rather interactive design models supporting a case. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated by constructing a running system and testing it with designers on realistic problems. The costs and benefits of creating and using documentation of design rationale also were analyzed. In particular, the active documents approach was evaluated for a routine, preliminary design in domains where community practice is widely shared and largely standardized. The approach depends on the feasibility of creating a parametric design model for the design domain. © 1994, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - We study the storage properties associated with generalized Hebbian learning rules which present four free parameters that allow for asymmetry. We also introduce two extra parameters in the post-synaptic potentials in order to further improve the critical capacity. Using signal-to-noise analysis, as well as computer simulations on an analog network, we discuss the performance of the rules for arbitrarily biased patterns and find that the critical storage capacity alpha c becomes maximal for a particular symmetric rule (alpha c diverges in the sparse coding limit). Departures from symmetry decrease alpha c but can increase the robustness of the model.

AB  - This paper describes HYCONES II--a tool to enable the construction of hybrid connectionist expert systems to solve classification problems. HYCONES II offers to the knowledge engineer a hybrid knowledge base that integrates frames with three different neural network models: the combinatorial neural model--CNM, the Fuzzy ARTMAP and the Semantic ART--SMART models. The latter is a new model, introduced by this paper, based on a combination of the two previous models. The validation section compares the performance of these three neural models to solve diagnostic problems in two medical domains. This paper also presents HYCONES II knowledge representation features, built in the symbolic component of its hybrid knowledge-base, to deal and represent fuzzy medical variables. Finally, the present status and future developments of the project are presented.

AB  - The problem of verifying the integrity of fuzzy knowledge bases is discussed. An approach to find potential inconsistencies in fuzzy rule based systems is described. The approach models the knowledge base as a High Level Fuzzy Petri Net and uses the structural properties of the net for verification. Basic notions on approximate reasoning, regular and hierarchical High Level Fuzzy Petri Nets are also given. The method used for consistency checking is reviewed through the analysis of several cases including simple and chaining rules. Procedures for discovering potential inconsistencies at both local and global levels are described. © 1994.

AB  - A competence theory of diagnosis that extends past efforts in this effort and provides further conceptual insight into the diagnostic reasoning process. A competence theory of diagnosis makes two major contributions. First, it provides a decomposition of diagnosis and defines the diagnostic goals for its constituents. Secondly, it describes how such goals can be achieved under specific conditions. Tasks and methods are organized in a task method decomposition structure.

AB  - The acquisition of connectivity patterns in an artificial, three-layer neural circuit for control of human gait was simulated through a backpropagation algorithm. Input signals for the neural network were equivalent to hip, knee, and ankle angles, and to vertical ground reaction forces during walking. Neural network outputs consisted of signals proportional to the activity of five lower limb muscles. Many network input configurations and connectivity restrictions were tested. Data from normal gait were used for network training. Preliminary testing of network responses in unknown environments was effected by presenting the neural networks with actual pathologic data at the input layer and by later investigating network outputs. Results favored restricted connectivity between middle and output layer neurons. Further, explicit recall of recent events was found to improve network behavior.

AB  - This paper looks at the intersections between feminist epistemology, feminist jurisprudence and research on artificial intelligence and the law. It is suggested that. feminist theory highlights the role of subjectivity which is ignored in the traditional epistemology of AI systems. This allows AI systems to appear to be “perspectiveless” when they may be tacitly used in a normative role which ignores alternative knowledges. The paper looks at the Cyc system as an example. In developing an expert system to advise on Sex Discrimination law a number of lessons are learned both from the Forms Helper system and more particularly from feminist jurisprudence and from the critique of AI from feminist epistemology. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - After brief considerations about intelligence, a comparative study between biologic and artificial intelligence is made. The specialists in Artificial Intelligence found that intelligence is purely a matter of physical symbol manipulation. The enterprise of Artificial Intelligence aims to understand what we might call Brain Intelligence in terms of concepts and techniques of engineering. However the philosophers believed that computer-machine can have syntax, but can never have semantics. In other words, that they can follow rules, such as those of arithmetic or grammar, but not understand what to us are meanings of symbols, such as words. In the present paper it is stressed that brain/mind complex constitutes a monolithic systemic that functions with emergent properties at several levels of hierarchical organization. These hierarchical levels are non-reducible to one another. They are at least three (neuronal, functional, and semantic), and they function within an interactional plan. The brain/mind complex, which transform informations in meanings, deals with problems by means of both logical and non-logical mechanisms; while logic allows the mind to arrange the elements for reasoning, the non-logical mechanisms (fuzzy logic, heuristics, insights) allows the mind to develop strategies to find solutions. The model for construction of the "intelligent machine" is the operating way of the brain/mind complex, which does not always use logical processes. The role of information science in Artificial Intelligence is to search for knowledge itself (virtual knowledge), rather than to simply attempt a logico-mathematical formalization of knowledge.

AB  - The paper introduces and studies an idea of distributed modeling treating it as a new paradigm of fuzzy system modeling and analysis. This form of modeling is oriented towards developing individual (local) fuzzy models for specific modeling landmarks (expressed as fuzzy sets) and determining the essential logical relationships between these local models. The models themselves are implemented in the form of logic processors being regarded as specialized fuzzy neural networks. The interaction between the processors is developed either in an inhibitory or excitatory way. In more descriptive way, the distributed model can be sought as a collection of fuzzy finite state machines with their individual local first or higher order memories. It is also clarified how the concept of distributed modeling narrows down a gap between purely numerical (quantitative) models and the qualitative ones originated within the realm of Artificial Intelligence. The overall architecture of distributed modeling is discussed along with the detailed learning schemes. The results of extensive simulation experiments are provided as well. © 1995 IEEE

AB  - In recent years, interest in the application of artificial intelligence technologies to power system operation, planning and design has grown rapidly. The application of non-symbolic techniques, particularly Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), is a new area of research in this field. In this paper, intelligent systems for solving power system state estimation problems are investigated. A new framework for the solution of the topology determination, observability analysis and bad data processing tasks is proposed. Pattern analysis techniques have been developed to deal with noisy environments. An ANN for topology determination and a supervised learning algorithm for very large training sets, the Optimal Estimate Training 2 (OET2), are introduced. OET2 overcomes the major shortcomings of the back-propagation learning rule and can also be very useful for other problems. Power system network decomposition techniques are used to decrease the computational burden of the topology classfier training session. Tests using the IEEE 24- and 118-bus systems illustrate situations in which the existent tools for data processing fail. © 1995.

AB  - The constrained two-dimensional cutting problem is concerned with the way a set of pieces should be cut from a plate, taking into account that the cuts are of the guillotine type and that the number of times a piece can be cut is limited. Both plate and pieces are rectangular shaped. Yr 1983, Wang proposed an algorithm for incremental development of rectangles. Later, Oliveira and Ferreira not only proposed but numerically tested an improvement to the algorithm as. A generalization of these methods is proposed. It will be stated that such methods are particular cases of uninformed search methods, widely studied in the area of Artificial Intelligence. Knowing that more efficient methods exist, namely 'informed methods', diffren alternatives to orientate the search process, while reducing the required computer memory and time, are defined. Using an adequate selection of an heuristic function it is possible to guarantee the determination of a best solution. Such ideas are numerically tested in this work. The results indicate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. © 1995.

AB  - In this study some considerations are presented regarding the utilization of the tools of Artificial Intelligence based on knowledge, in order to assist engineers in scheduling manufacturing processes. To this end, a revision of concepts and characteristics of expert systems is also presented here. There are many aspects to be considered on choosing a tool of Artificial Intelligence for use in a given area of the business. For scheduling, specifically, the situation is not at all different. In this case, one must take into consideration the fact that the scheduling sector is not isolated within the company, whether it renders service or is an industry. Manufacturing acts as a whole unit and when considering it as part of this context, the other sectors should also be known, not in details, but it should be clear where and when scheduling interacts with one of the other areas. And then through an analysis of these interactions and based on the results, it is possible to choose the software tools suitable to the problem. In addition to the aspect of choosing the appropriate tool of Artificial Intelligence, the study presents a discussion on some softwares of Artificial Intelligence, specific to manufacturing scheduling, known in the literature and utilized in big companies in recent years.

AB  - The problem of scheduling projects is dealt with in this study with the aim of comparing tools in order to find the optimum or near-optimum solution. There is an infinite number of tools that serve this purpose, both the traditional ones based on more sophisticated mathematical formulations, and the more modern and experimental ones that utilize techniques of artificial intelligence. The conventional methods with a mathematical basis, exemplified by the technique of Branch and Bound, and those using specific computational packages to find solutions, such as GAMS, are highly efficient in solving problems of project scheduling that consider the temporal organization of a set of tasks so as to fulfil given objectives. In this type of problem, restrictions involving resources and various other restrictions are considered in order to schedule the project. In recent years many different ways of solving problems were employed in order to find the best solution for this kind of scheduling, which nearly always turns out to involve an extremely complex problem of overall scheduling when real situations are considered. At present much more modern methods have arisen to solve problem, within the technique of Artificial Intelligence, bringing advantages and disadvantages. This technique was devised to help choose the most suitable tool for the problem at hand.

AB  - This article presents a resume of extensive research carried out in the area of construction of pre-molded parts. The problem was studied under several different aspects, such as construction, computation, planning, and good results were obtained. Construction with pre-molded elements means a promising future for Brazil. At present, little of this kind of construction has been done in the country, considering the total number of constructions. Nevertheless, it is a practical construction, used all over the world, and offers a number of advantages over conventional construction. In the social area it is quite important, for this kind of construction was utilized to reconstruct European cities after the wars of this century. At that time, great projects were carried out by architects of renown, such as Cropius and Le Corbusier, who left a mark in the history of civil construction.

AB  - The first and the important phase of distributed problem solving is problem decomposition. However, most of the approaches in Distributed AI or Multi-agent systems proceed with the assumption that the problem is already decomposed and concentrate on the other issues. In this paper we present a step towards a methodology for decomposing a given problem either spatially, temporally or by abstraction. Features of these different types are compared and technique for implementing the process is given. Still a lot remains to be done before we can arrive at an application independent formalism to decompose a problem. However, the paper attempts to describe tasks and their interdependencies through the formalism. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The increase of computing power of the microcomputers has stimulated the building of direct manipulation interfaces that allow graphical representation of Linear Programming (LP) models. This work discusses the components of such a graphical interface as the basis for a system to assist users in the process of formulating LP problems. In essence, this work proposes a methodology which considers the modelling task as divided into three stages which are specification of the Data Model, the Conceptual Model and the LP Model. The necessity for using Artificial Intelligence techniques in the problem conceptualisation and to help the model formulation task is illustrated.

AB  - Image registration is one of the basic image processing operations in remote sensing. With the increase in the number of in, ages collected every day from different sensors, automated registration of multisensor/multispectral images has become a very important issue. A wide range of registration techniques has been developed for many different types of applications and data. Given the diversity of the data, it is unlikely that a single registration scheme will work satisfactorily for all different applications. A possible solution is to integrate multiple registration algorithms into a rule-based artificial intelligence system so that appropriate methods for any given set of multisensor data can be automatically selected. The first step in the development of such an expert system for remote sensing application would be to obtain a better understanding and characterization of the various existing techniques for image registration. This is the main objective of this paper as we present a comparative study of some recent image registration methods. We emphasize in particular techniques for multisensor image data, and a brief discussion of each of the techniques is given. This comprehensive study will enable the user to select algorithms that work best for his/her particular application domain.

AB  - Neural networks are a relatively new computer artificial intelligence method which attempt to mimic the brain's problem solving process and can be used for predicting nonlinear economic time series. Neural networks are used to look for patterns in data, learn these patterns, and then classify new patterns and make forecasts. Feedforward neural networks pass the data forward from input to output, while recurrent networks have a feedback loop where data can be fed back into the input at some point before it is fed forward again for further processing and final output. Some have argued that since time series data may have autocorrelation or time dependence, the recurrent neural network models which take advantage of time dependence may be useful. Feedforward and recurrent neural networks are used for comparison in forecasting the Japanese yen/US dollar exchange rate. A traditional ARIMA model is used as a benchmark for comparison with the neural network models. Results for out of sample show that the feedforward model is relatively accurate in forecasting both price levels and price direction, despite being quite simple and easy to use. However, the recurrent network forecast performance was lower than that of the feedforward model. This may be because feed forward models must pass the data from back to forward as well as forward to back, and can sometimes become confused or unstable. Both the feedforward and recurrent models performed better than the ARIMA benchmark model. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Artificial neural networks can represent and handle information by means of interconnected processing elements, in a manner similar to that of biologic neurons. Artificial neural networks are useful in processing time-patterned biologic signals, such as electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms, particularly in tasks involving pattern classification and recognition. They do not need to be programmed, since they are capable of learning. Using artificial neural networks to build associative memories and perform true parallel processing permits "intelligent" biomedical instrumentation.

AB  - Hycones II is a tool that facilitates the construction of hybrid connectionist expert systems to solve problems in classification. Hycones II provides a hybrid system that integrates frames with three types of neural network: the "combinatorial" neural model (CNM), the "Fuzzy ARTMAP" model, and the "Semantic ART" (SMART) model, a combination of the CNM and Fuzzy ARTMAP. We will compare the ability of these three models to solve diagnostic problems in two medical domains.

AB  - A real time knowledge processing procedure is proposed for rule-based systems in general and control systems applications in particular. Distinguishing features of the procedure include a mechanism for rule base compression and an inference scheme based on matrix operators. The procedure is also amenable for schedulability analysis to provide response time warranty An application concerning supervisory group control of elevators is also included to show the usefulness of the proposed procedure. ©1996 IEEE.

AB  - Energy is continuously dissipated in electric power systems due to electrical resistance in transmission and distribution lines. This paper addresses the problem of obtaining a network topology with minimum energy losses for electric power distribution systems. As distribution networks must operate radially, the problem can be formulated as a generalization of the minimum spanning tree problem. The generalization is due to variation in costs as network configuration changes. Nonlinear network flow techniques are teamed with search strategies borrowed from the field of artificial intelligence to overcome computation intractability. © 1997 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The accurate diagnosis of accidents in a nuclear power plant has fundamental importance for decision making necessary to mitigate their consequences for the power plant as well as for the general public, on the basis of emergency planning. Two main characteristics should be achieved in this kind of diagnostics, namely, real-time features and adaptive capacity. The first characteristic gives the operators the possibility of predicting degraded operations and monitoring critical safety functions related to that specific situation. The second one allows the system to be able to deal with accidents that were not incorporated in the training sample set, in which case the operators are unprepared because they were not trained to face an event that they did not observe even in simulator training. The Three Mile Island accident is a classic one to demonstrate that these kinds of events are possible. Several methodologies have been tried to match those characteristics. While the first one is achieved through the permanent evolution of new faster processors, the second one can only be achieved through the simulation of human cognitive processes, which show higher adaptive behavior. Our model utilizes a neural network, fuzzy sets, and a genetic algorithm to simulate that behavior. We have used a neural network activated by an additive model and trained with an unsupervised competitive training law. Once trained with three accidents (steam generator tube rupture, blackout, and loss-of-coolant accident), a synoptic matrix was obtained, in which the elements represent the interchanging weights between neurons in the concatenated input/output space and the competitive neurons that fight to encode the input-output vector. This kind of competition establishes a statistical classification of the state variables, changing with time, clustering them in centroids labeling the kind of accident for which variables are being sampled. Thus, the accident identification is done in real time with the synaptic matrix. However, the centroids are located in the same time value, in view of the fact that the neural network algorithm treats the variable time as an independent one. Therefore, a genetic algorithm is applied to a fuzzy system formed by the partition of the variables space with fuzzy sets determined by the neural network centroids, in order to estimate the optimal positions in the time variable where the fuzzy system centroids must be located. As a consequence, the diagnostic can be done in representative regions of each accident with maximum confidence.

AB  - A comprehensive survey of computer-based systems that apply artificial intelligence methods to detect and identify component faults in nuclear power plants is presented. Classification criteria are established that categorize artificial intelligence diagnostic systems according to the types of computing approaches used (e.g., computing tools, computer languages, and shell and simulation programs), the types of methodologies employed (e.g., types of knowledge, reasoning and inference mechanisms, and diagnostic approach), and the scope of the system. The major issues of process diagnostics and computer-based diagnostic systems are identified and cross-correlated with the various categories used for classification. Ninety-five publications are reviewed.

AB  - The present paper proposes a hybrid approach based on reactive agent technology as a post-object paradigm for building intelligent CAD systems. It represents an evolution of previous positions and articles by the authors motivated by a clear need to provide forms of active support for the design process rather than seeking full design automation purposes. Key concepts about agency and reactivity, as well as their usefulness in design systems, are presented. Also a basic tool called XLOG+, for developing agent-based systems, comprising logic and object oriented approaches, is discussed. Finally, the proposed hybrid agents are embedded in a new integrated CAD system architecture and an implemented prototype example in the area of solid modelling is briefly presented. © 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

AB  - This paper introduces Chart D2, a Congenital Heart Disease Diagnostician that employs a case-based model where specific and general knowledge are combined in reasoning. Specific knowledge is represented in the form of cases while general knowledge is represented in the form of category descriptors. When solving a new case, Chart D2 uses its general knowledge to draw hypotheses and to guide the search for the most similar cases it has already "seen". The retrieved cases, representing specific knowledge, are then used to support one of the hypotheses and to justify the conclusion reached. Chart D2 has been based on an earlier hybrid connectionist/symbolic program called Hycones, developed in the same application domain. Besides enhancing some of Hycones' capabilities, the new system proposes solutions for common problems in Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), such as case matching, indexing and learning. The system Chart D2 is presented and evaluated, using real cases collected from a medical database. The performance of the system is contrasted with that of Hycones and two other learning algorithms. Moreover, similar research efforts on the use of other sources of knowledge by CBR systems are discussed, and topics for further research are suggested.

AB  - A procedure for the identification of substituent groups (viz. angelate, tiglate, etc.) attached to any of the atoms in the conventional skeleton of a natural product is described. It consists in the use of the program MACRONO, which was developed for finding subspectra due to the carbons in the said substituent groups amid the raw 13C NMR spectroscopic data from any given natural product (by means of comparisons of all possible subsets of the observed chemical shifts with those contained in an apposite database, built with literature 13C NMR spectroscopic data regarding those groups). This procedure enables one to expunge the chemical shifts not due to skeletal carbons from the initial dataset, which then can be input to the expert system SISTEMAT, for skeletal identification. © 1997 - IOS Press.

AB  - This essay describes another improvement to the expert system named SISTEMAT. The purpose of such improvement is to help chemists who work with natural products to figure out chemical structures. SISTEMAT uses Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) 13C data to ensemble compatible substructures according to related spectra. The system also is able to suggest a list of probable carbon skeletons. Those will work as models to structure generating programs, reducing the combinatorial explosion problem. This is the first essay from our research group which shows our system applications to aromatic compounds. A database with 700 NMR 13C spectra of flavonoids obtained from the literature was used. We applied heuristic SISTEMAT in order to discover ranges of chemical shifts that characterise several skeleton types. The diversity of flavonoid structures is due to several oxidation patterns at rings A and B. This phenomenon causes a great complexity in the absorptions at the aromatic region. Heuristic SISTEMAT was able to discover more accurate rules that differentiate specific patterns of oxidation for some skeleton types. The performance of the software was checked against a higher complex structure of a dimeric flavonoid recently isolated. The system gives only two possibilities of skeleton types (among 70 others). Both substructures found by the program showed correct linkages between carbons 2 and 7″ and 4 and 8″ of the monomers. © 1997 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, parsimonious covering theory is extended in such a way that temporal knowledge can be accommodated. In addition to causally associating possible manifestations with disorders, temporal relationships about duration and the time elapsed before a manifestation comes into existence can be represented by a graph. Precise definitions of the solution of a temporal diagnostic problem, as well as algorithms to compute the solutions are provided. The medical suitability of the extended parsimonious cover theory is studied in the domain of food-borne disease.

AB  - This paper presents a knowledge-based decision support system to assist mechanical ventilation in patients with the Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (DSSARDS). The knowledge base uses clinical algorithms developed from interviews and seminars with experts. The system contains 140 rules, applies backward chaining and was built on an IBM-PC compatible microcomputer. Clinical and physiological data and ventilator settings were used for suggestions of ventilatory support mode: (VSMODE) and settings (MVSET) and for hemodynamic evaluation and therapy (HEMO). Success rates (s) and kappa coefficient (k) were used to measure agreement between DSSARDS and physicians at 4 decision steps related to: beginning of mechanical ventilation (FIRSTSET), VSMODE, MVSET and HEMO. DSSARDS prototype was evaluated in a development phase with 6 patients aged 48.6 ± 15.9 years. Agreement results for 142 decision steps were: FIRSTSET k = 0.90, s = 0.93; VSMODE k = 0.76, s = 0.92; HEMO k = 0.58, s = 0.70, MVSET k = 0.86, s = 0.92 (p < 0.05 for all k). Improvements in the knowledge base were performed mainly in HEMO and VSMODE modules. The subsequent test phase studied 5 patients aged 54.8 ± 11.0 years in a total of 900 decision steps. Results were: FIRSTSET k = 0.93, s = 0.95; VSMODE k = 0.93, s = 0.96; HEMO k = 0.97, s = 0.99, MVSET k = 0.96, s = 0.97 (p < 0.05 for all k). The results indicate significant agreement between DSSARDS and physicians for all decision steps. This suggests that DSSARDS may be used as a support for decision making and a training tool for mechanical ventilation in patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome.

AB  - The combination of the techniques of expert systems and neural networks has the potential of producing more powerful systems; for example, expert systems able to learn from experience. In this paper, we address the combinatorial neural model (CNM), a kind of fuzzy neural network able to accommodate in a simple framework the highly desirable property of incremental learning, as well as the usual capabilities of expert systems. We show how an interval-based representation for membership grades makes CNM capable of reasoning with several types of uncertainty: vagueness, ignorance, and relevance commonly found in practical applications. In addition, we show how basic functions of expert systems such as inference, inquiry, censorship of input information, and explanation may be implemented. We also report experimental results of the application of CNM to the problem of deforestation monitoring of the Amazon region using satellite images. © 1997 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial intelligence techniques, such as fuzzy logic, neural network, and genetic algorithm, are recently showing a lot of promise in the application of power electronic systems. The paper describes the control strategy development, design, and experimental performance evaluation of a fuzzy-logic-based variable-speed wind generation system that uses a cagetype induction generator and double-sided pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) converters. The system can feed a utility grid maintaining unity power factor at all conditions or can supply an autonomous load. The fuzzy-logic-based control of the system helps to optimize efficiency and enhance performance. A complete 3.5-kW generation system has been developed, designed, and thoroughly evaluated by laboratory tests, in order to validate the predicted performance improvements. The system gives excellent performance and can easily be translated to a larger size in the field. © 1997 IEEE.

AB  - Petróleo Brasileiro S. A. (PETROBRÁS) in conjunction with Synergetics Science and Technology Inc. has developed a comprehensive graduate level educational program in intelligent system design technology. The primary goals of this program are: training professionals to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Neural Networks (NN) techniques to managerial and technological problem solving, and to do this in a manner that is both time-and cost-effective. This particular program has been centered around two distinct areas of specialization: symbolic AI and the connectionist approach (NN's). The AI section of the course is titled CAVIAR. The NN section of the course is titled CERN. Short courses and seminars were also part of the program. For this paper, our focus has been to deal with the special needs of graduate-level education in large companies as part of employee professional training. We will also explore the nuances of, and the various needs associated with teaching intelligent system design technologies to such a diverse group, as is found in large companies like PETROBRÁS. This paper also describes the needs that led to the development of such a broad-based program, the goals and structures of the various courses, the student profiles, educational facilities (libraries and computer laboratories), and the lessons learned. Finally, the conclusion offers recommendations.

AB  - The BF-graphs form a particular class of Directed Hypergraphs. For this important family, different applications are known in data bases and artificial intelligence domain. They may also be used to describe the behaviour of concurrent systems. We present here a theoretical analysis of several hyperpath problems in BF-graphs, with emphasis on the acyclic BF-graphs. After briefly exposing the basic concepts of directed hypergraphs, we present an algorithm for finding a BF-path. We next discuss the problem of finding a hyperpath cover, and present a polynomial solution for two constrained hyperpath problems. © Elsevier, Paris.

AB  - This paper is an evolution of a previous article by the authors1 (Bento, J. P., Feijó, B., Lloyd-Smith, D., Computers and Structures, 1977, 63(5), 1015-1032) motivated by the need to provide computational support to an agent-based implementation of design processes. It presents a new programming environment to support the development of CAD systems based on a hybrid agent architecture in which the symbolic reasoning is carried out by first-order logic. The reactive behaviour of the agents can be achieved through a number of characteristics proposed for the object-oriented environment. This environment is also a general proposal for representing engineering design knowledge in which logic is integrated into an object-oriented paradigm. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Limited.

AB  - Imperfect information is a very general term that comprises different types of information, such as uncertain, vague, fuzzy, inconsistent, possibilistic, probabilistic, partially or totally incomplete information [2]. In the literature of knowledge representation we find a different formal model for each one of these distinct types. For example, annotated logic is a formal model to represent inconsistent information. Annotated logics are non-classical logics introduced in [20] as a logic programming theory. They were proved to be paraconsistent. Based on [5], we present in this work the annotated logic programming theory and some of its applications in Artificial Intelligence (AI). We present it as a formalism to reason with inconsistent information and investigate its possibility to represent other types of imperfect information, such as possibilistic and non-monotonic reasoning. Our main goal is to verify and confirm the importance of annotated logics as a tool for developing knowledge-based and automated reasoning systems in AI.

AB  - This paper describes IDSSFLEX, a computer system for the analysis and evaluation of Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) design configurations. IDSSFLEX is an intelligent decision support system which selects from among several configurations and control strategy alternatives of design, the most appropriate one for a specific case. In order to accomplish such an objective, the system presents simultaneously the following features: ability to quantify subjective factors, ability to account for individual preferences, and ability to cope with multiple criteria decision making. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of the computer system. © 1998 Operational Research Society Ltd. All Rights reserved.

AB  - A widespread search strategy employed by predators in both vertebrate and invertebrate phyla is the well-known area-restricted search strategy. The generality, simplicity, and effectiveness of this strategy have made it emerge many times during the course of natural selection. In this work, an artificial intelligence state-space search procedure is developed using search guidelines gleaned from the foraging behavior of predators. This procedure, which we call predatory search, has been implemented on a NP-Hard combinatorial problem: the traveling salesman problem. Numerical results are presented for a limited set of benchmark problems, and area-restricted search seems to be effective: We have been able to find the optimal solution to, among others, a 400-city Manhattan problem.

AB  - Neural computation represents one of the fastest growing areas in artificial intelligence. Considering that the major limit of the thermalhydraulic design of PWR type nuclear reactors consists in the occurrence of critical heat flux (CHF), in the present work, it is developed an artificial neural net for the prediction of occurrence of CHF, utilizing experimental data obtained in rod bundle water flows for the net training. Application is performed for the range of the operational parameters of reactor INAP-11, being developed by CTM/SP. It was observed that the standard deviation of the final results, given by the net for the ratio between experimental and theoretical results for the CHF, is lower than those given by the EPRI and EPRI_MOD correlations, coupled to the COBRA-IV code, and that the average presents a very small deviation from the expected unity value.

AB  - The column generation approach to large-scale linear programming is extended to the mixed-integer case. Two general algorithms, a dual and a primal one, are presented. Both involve finding k-best solutions to combinatorial optimization subproblems. Algorithms for these subproblems must be tailored to each specific application. Their use is illustrated by applying them to a new combinatorial optimization problem with applications in Artificial Intelligence: Probabilistic Maximum Satisfiability. This problem is defined as follows: consider a set of logical sentences together with probabilities that they are true, assume this set of sentences is not satisfiable in the probabilistic sense, i.e., there is no probability distribution on the set of possible worlds (truth assignments to the sentences corresponding to at least one truth assignment to the logical variables they contain) such that for each sentence the sum of probabilities of the possible worlds in which it is true is equal to its probability of being true; determine a minimum set of sentences to be deleted in order to make the remaining set of sentences satisfiable. Computational experience with both algorithms is reported on. © 1998 Published byElsevier Science B.V.

AB  - To enhance power systems stability, extensive research has been conducted in the area of synchronous machines control, and several techniques and algorithms have been developed and implemented in real applications. One of the latest and most sophisticated techniques is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) based control. Increased interest has been focused in the use of these algorithms in control systems; different approaches have been proposed for their application. The results presented on several research papers show the advantages of such algorithms over the conventional control algorithms. In this paper, the problem of synchronous machines control is considered, and an overview of several artificial intelligence approaches as applied to the control of synchronous generators is presented. A critical and evaluating discussion on each Al approach is also included.

AB  - In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in the development of a class of artificial intelligent systems. This growing new class of technology has been applied successfully to a wide variety of applications. It is now becoming increasingly evident that in many cases best results can be obtained through the use of combination of such intelligent systems. In this paper, a class of hybrid intelligent systems has been applied in diagnosing a variety of faults in a range of electric power system equipments. The nature of the faults are diverse and no single intelligent algorithm is able to classify the faults. However, it is shown, in this paper, that a combinatorial intelligent system based on neuro-fuzzy, neuro-expert and fuzzy-expert algorithms can be successfully applied in the detection of a number of faults in a range of equipments. Test results using measurements on in-service power transformers in the Australian state of New South Wales and on a distribution feeder belonging to CEMIG, Brazil have been used to show the effectiveness of the proposed class of hybrid intelligent systems in equipment fault diagnosis.

AB  - This paper presents an intelligent agent model for simulating the behavior of a jazz bass player during live performance. In jazz performance, there is a strikingly large gap between the instructions given in a chord grid and the music actually being played. To bridge this gap, we integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods within the intelligent agent paradigm, focusing on two critical aspects. First, the experience acquired by musicians in terms of previously heard or played melodic fragments, which are stored in the agent's ''musical memory''. Second, the use of these known fragments within the evolving context of live improvisation. In previous papers, we have presented a model for an improvising bass player, emphasizing the underlying problem solving method. In this paper, we describe the fully implemented model and give more details on how melodic fragments are represented, indexed and retrieved. © 1999, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper aims at integrating the work on analogical reasoning in Cognitive Science into the long trend of philosophical interest, in this century, in analogical reasoning as a basis for scientific modeling. In the first part of the paper, three simulations of analogical reasoning, proposed in cognitive science, are presented: Gentner's Structure Matching Engine, Mitchel's and Hofstadter's COPYCAT and the Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine, proposed by Holyoak and Thagard. The differences and controversial points in these simulations are highlighted in order to make explicit their presuppositions concerning the nature of analogical reasoning. In the last part, this debate in cognitive science is applied to some traditional philosophical accounts of formal and material analogies as a basis for scientific modeling, like Mary Hesse's, and to more recent ones, that already draw from the work in Artificial Intelligence, like that proposed by Aronson, Harré and Way. © 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

An artificial neural network is developed to calculate a membership set for model parameters. Techniques of fuzzy logic control lead the network to its equilibrium points. Simulated examples are presented as an illustration of the proposed technique. The result represent a significant improvement over previously proposed methods. © 1999 IMACS/Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The use of a linguistic representation for expressing knowledge acquired by learning systems is an important issue as regards to user understanding. Under this assumption, and to make sure that these systems will be welcome and used, several techniques have been developed by the artificial intelligence community, under both the symbolic and the connectionist approaches. This work discusses and investigates three knowledge extraction techniques based on these approaches. The first two techniques, the C4.5 and CN2 symbolic learning algorithms, extract knowledge directly from the data set. The last technique, the TREPAN algorithm extracts knowledge from a previously trained neural network. The CN2 algorithm induces if...then rules from a given data set. The C4.5 algorithm extracts decision trees, although it can also extract ordered rules, from the data set. Decision trees are also the knowledge representation used by the TREPAN algorithm.

AB  - The problem of obtaining a network configuration of minimum energy losses for electric power distribution systems is addressed. It can be regarded as a generalization of the minimum spanning tree problem, where edge costs varies as the configuration changes. A solution is found with a recursive two-step procedure: the constraint of radial operation is relaxed in the first step, leading to an optimistic solution (a lower bound); information from this approximate solution is used in the second step to approach a feasible optimal solution. Non-linear network flow optimization techniques team with search strategies from the field of artificial intelligence to cope with computation intractability. Parallel processing speeds the search of optimal solutions. A case study sheds light on the possibilities and limitations of the procedure.

AB  - The multi-agent systems paradigm represents one of the most promising approaches to the development of agile scheduling systems in manufacturing. Innovative and balanced perspectives of multi-agent approaches to agile scheduling are discussed in this paper, and several achieved results and current developments are described. The description of the multi-agent framework emphasizes the use of negotiation mechanism to improve the scheduling flexibility, as well as the aspects of information integration, communication and coordination in a community of agents. For information integration and management various approaches are addressed and the utilization of a distributed/federated database management system is suggested. Finally, some innovative aspects for agile scheduling are introduced, particularly in the context of virtual enterprise environments.

AB  - This paper deals with the problem of linear gate assignment in two layout styles: one-dimensional logic array and gate matrix layout. The goal is to find the optimal sequencing of gates in order to minimize the required number of tracks, and thus to reduce the overall circuit layout area. This is known to be an NP-Hard optimization problem, for whose solution no absolute approximation algorithm exists. Here we report the use of a new optimization heuristic derived from statistical mechanics-the microcanonical optimization algorithm, fiO-to solve the linear gate assignment problem. Our numerical results show that juO compares favorably with at least five previously employed heuristics: simulated annealing, the unidirectional and the bidirectional Hong construction methods, and the artificial intelligence heuristics G M Plan and G M Learn. We also show how the algorithm is able to outperform microcanonical annealing. Moreover, in a massive set of experiments with circuits whose optimal layout is not known, our algorithm has been able to match and even to improve, by as much as seven tracks, the best solutions known so far. © 1999 IEEE.

AB  - We present in this paper an algorithm that infers data-flow for programs written in Logic language. No declaration about data-flow is required from the user. Basically, the algorithm consists of a symbolic execution of a program in order to find out data-flow directions for all predicate argument positions. It handles ground, no-ground and partially ground arguments, where the latter ones may occur in compound arguments. The data-flow directions are synthesized from a given program and a proposed goal. If an argument is a compound type argument it can have multiple data-flow directions, instead of a unique one. It happens when this argument is partially ground.

AB  - This paper deals with the problem of linear gate assignment in two layout styles: one-dimensional logic array and gate matrix layout. The goal is to find the optimal sequencing of gates in order to minimize the required number of tracks, and thus to reduce the overall circuit layout area. This is known to be an NP-Hard optimization problem, for whose solution no absolute approximation algorithm exists. Here we report the use of a new optimization heuristic derived from statistical mechanics - the microcanomical optimization algorithm, μO - to solve the linear gate assignment problem. Our numerical results show that μO compares favorably with at least five previously employed heuristics: simulated annealing, the unidirectional and the bidirectional Hong construction methods, and the artificial intelligence heuristics GM_Plan and GM_Learn. We also show how the algorithm is able to outperform microcanonical annealing. Moreover, in a massive set of experiments with circuits whose optimal layout is not known, our algorithm has been able to match and even to improve, by as much as seven tracks, the best solutions known so far.

AB  - The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is one of the most successfull techniques that have been used to recognize faces in images. This technique consists of extracting the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of an image from a covariance matrix, which is constructed from an image database. These eigenvectors and eigenvalues are used for image classification, obtaining nice results as far as face recognition is concerned. However, the high computational cost is a major problem of this technique, mainly when real-time applications are involved. There are some evidences that the performance of a PCA-based system that uses only the region around the eyes as input is very close to a system that uses the whole face. In this case, it is possible to implement faster PCA-based face recognition systems, because only a small region of the image is considered. This paper reports some results that corroborate this thesis, which have been obtained within the context of an ongoing project for the development of a performance assessment framework for face recognition systems. The results of two PCA-based recognition experiments are reported: the first one considers a more complete face region (from the eyebrows to the chin), while the second is a sub-region of the first, containing only the eyes. Themain contributions of the present paper are the description of the performance assessment framework (which is still under development), the results of the two experiments and a discussion of some possible reasons for them. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.

AB  - This work presents a real time system for detection and tracking of facial features in video sequences. Such system may be used in visual communication applications, such as teleconferencing, virtual reality, intelligent interfaces, human machine interaction, surveillance, etc. We have used a statistical skin-color model to segment face-candidate regions in the image. The presence or absence of a face in each region is verified by means of an eye detector, based on an efficient template matching scheme. Once a face is detected, the pupils, nostrils and lip corners are located and these facial features are tracked in the image sequence, performing real time processing. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.

AB  - One of the new research tendencies within the well-established cluster computing area is the growing interest in the use of multiple workstation clusters as a single virtual parallel machine, in much the same way as individual workstations are nowadays connected to build a single parallel cluster. In this paper we present an analysis on several aspects concerning the integration of different workstation clusters, such as Myrinet and SCI, and propose our MultiCluster model as an alternative to achieve such integrated architecture. © 2000 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - We propose a general framework for combining mobile processes and declarative programming languages, e.g., functional, logic or functional-logic languages. In contrast to existing concurrent extensions of declarative languages, we distinguish clearly between the notion of processes and that of functions or predicates. Thus, our framework is generic and may be applied to extend several kinds of declarative languages. It also extends PA process algebra in order to deal with parameter passing, mobile processes and interactive declarative programming. In our setting, declarative programs are dynamic and may be modified thanks to the actions performed by processes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.

AB  - In the Web, there are classes of pages with similar structuring and contents (e.g., call for papers pages, references, etc), which are interrelated forming clusters (e.g., Science). We propose an architecture of cognitive multi-agent systems for information retrieval and extraction from these clusters. Each agent processes one class employing reusable ontologies to recognize pages, extract all possible useful information and communicate with the others agents. Whenever it identifies information interesting to another agent, it forwards this information to that agent. These "hot hints" usually contain much less garbage than search engine results do. The agent architecture presents many sorts of reuse: all the code, DB definitions, knowledge and services of the search engines. We got promising results using Java and Jess. © Springer-Verlag 2000.

AB  - Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence provide suitable techniques to improve computer games quality. While the former offers mechanisms to model environment and characters' physical features, the latter provides models and tools for building characters, namely Synthetic Actors or Believable Agents, which can exhibit intelligent social behaviour and express personality and emotions. The current architecture proposals for Synthetic Actors do not fully meet the requirements for long-term games development, such as strategy and adventure ones, it is necessary to guarantee both personality stability and reactive emotional responses, which may be contradictory. In this work, we propose a new Synthetic Actor model that tightly connects emotions and social attitudes to personality, providing a long-term coherent behaviour. This model has been applied to two games presented here as case studies. © Springer-Verlag London Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes a drug ordering decision support system that helps with the prevention of adverse drug events by detecting drug-drug interactions in drug orders. The architecture of the system was devised in order to facilitate its use attached to physician order entry systems. The described model focuses in issues related to knowledge base maintenance and integration with external systems. Finally, a retrospective study was performed. Two knowledge bases, developed by different academic centers, were used to detect drug-drug interactions in a dataset with 37,237 drug prescriptions. The study concludes that the proposed knowledge base architecture enables content from other knowledge sources to be easily transferred and adapted to its structure. The study also suggests a method that can be used on the evaluation and refinement of the content of drug knowledge bases.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of an original hierarchical neural model on a complex sequence - the complete sixteenth four-part fugue in G minor of the Well-Tempered Clavier (vol. I) of J. S. Bach. The model makes an effective use of context information, through its hierarchical topology and its embedded time integrators, and that enables it to keep a very good account of past events. The model performs sequence classification and discrimination efficiently. It has application in domains which require pattern recognition, or particularly, which demand recognising either a set of sequences of vectors in time, or suh-sequences into a unique and large sequence of vectors in time.

AB  - Bongard problems present an outstanding challenge to artificial intelligence. They consist of visual pattern understanding problems on which the task of the pattern perceiver is to find an abstract aspect of distinction between two classes of figures. This paper examines the philosophical question of whether objects in Bongard problems can be ascribed an a priori, metaphysical, existence - the ontological question of whether objects, and their boundaries, come pre-defined, independently of any understanding or context. This is an essential issue, because it determines whether a priori symbolic representations can be of use for solving Bongard problems. The resulting conclusion of this analysis is that in the case of Bongard problems there can be no units ascribed an a priori existence - and thus the objects dealt with in any specific problem must be found by solution methods (rather than given to them). This view ultimately leads to the emerging alternatives to the philosophical doctrine of metaphysical realism.

AB  - We propose a communication technique that uses modeling of language in the encoding-decoding process of message transmission. A temporal partition (time-delay coarse graining of the phase space based on the symbol sequence statistics) is introduced with little if any intervention required for the targeting of the trajectory. Message transmission is performed by means of codeword, i.e., specific targeting instructions are sent to the receiver rather than the explicit message. This approach yields (i) error correction availability for transmission in the presence of noise or dropouts, (ii) transmission in a compressed format, (iii) a high level of security against undesirable detection, and (iv) language recognition. © 2000 The American Physical Society.

AB  - We are concerned in this paper with learning classification procedures from known cases. More precisely, we provide a diagnostic model that discriminate between cerebellum-pontine angle (CPA) tumors and otorhinolaryngological (ENT) disorders. Usually, in order to distinguish between CPA tumors and ENT disorders one must perform clinical-neurological examination together with expensive radiological imagery (CT and MRI). The proposed model was obtained through artificial intelligence methods and presented a good accuracy level (88.4%) when tested against new cases, considering only clinical examination without radiological imagery results.

AB  - Autonomous learning techniques are based on experience acquisition. In most realistic applications, experience is time-consuming: it implies sensor reading, actuator control and algorithmic update, constrained by the learning system dynamics. The information crudeness upon which classical learning algorithms operate make such problems too difficult and unrealistic. Nonetheless, additional information for facilitating the learning process ideally should be embedded in such a way that the structural, well-studied characteristics of these fundamental algorithms are maintained. We investigate in this article a more general formulation of the Q-learning method that allows for a spreading of information derived from single updates towards a neighbourhood of the instantly visited state and converges to optimality. We show how this new formulation can be used as a mechanism to safely embed prior knowledge about the structure of the state space, and demonstrate it in a modified implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm in a real robot navigation task.

AB  - Based on an industrial survey with experts, this paper discusses relevant aspects regarding the way in which fluid power systems are designed. The paper briefly describes a computational support tool, developed as a prototype, to improve the design process in this area. The description includes issues of knowledge representation, domain selection, the expert system design process and validation; it also presents a development time frame and industrial potential related to the system. The paper suggests ways of applying such system in order to provide a training facility for new engineers and an empowering tool for experiencing designers, to integrate different knowledge sources in a computational environment, and to apply Internet technologies to facilitate communications among design agents.

AB  - One of the major interests in soil analysis is the evaluation of its chemical, physical and biological parameters, which are indicators of soil quality (the most important is the organic matter). Besides there is a great interest in the study of humic substances and on the assessment of pollutants, such as pesticides and heavy metals, in soils. Chemometrics is a powerful tool to deal with these problems and can help soil researchers to extract much more information from their data. In spite of this, the presence of these kinds of strategies in the literature has obtained projection only recently. The utilization of chemometric methods in soil analysis is evaluated in this article. The applications will be divided in four parts (with emphasis in the first two): (i) descriptive and exploratory methods based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA); (ii) multivariate calibration methods (MLR, PCR and PLS); (iii) methods such as Evolving Factor Analysis and SIMPLISMA; and (iv) artificial intelligence methods, such as Artificial Neural Networks.

AB  - We present in this paper an approach to providing cooperativeness in database querying using artificial intelligence techniques. The main focus is a cooperative interface that assists nonexperienced and casual users in extracting useful answers from a relational database. Our approach relies on an architecture that comprises two knowledge bases which store rules that describe the application domain and guide the process of query formulation and answering. A subset of SQL is used for expressing queries, and the cooperative interface relieves the user from knowing its full syntax and the structure of the database.

AB  - This article investigates the computation of posterior upper expectations induced by imprecise probabilities, with emphasis on the effects of irrelevance and independence judgements. Algorithms that handle imprecise priors and imprecise likelihoods are reviewed, and a new result on the limiting divergence of posterior upper probabilities is presented. Algorithms that handle irrelevance and independence relations in multivariate models are analyzed through graphical representations, inspired by the popular Bayesian network model. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Expert systems are among the most practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI). An expert system with a concurrent engineering perspective can support the design of hydraulic systems. Hydraulic systems are made up of pre-engineered components that each has a specific function. Design procedures for hydraulic systems are very important for developing expert systems, and the component-oriented nature of fluid power systems is an ideal fit.

AB  - Robotic soccer has been adopted as a standard problem so that various theories, algorithms, models, performance, and architectures can be evaluated and a wide range of technologies needs to be integrated, promoting both robotics and AI research. This paper describes our experience in these aspects, providing detailed description of the software modules adopted in the construction of the GUARANA robot-soccer team, one of the Brazilian teams at FIRA'98 Games - Federation of International Robot-soccer Association. First we describe the vision layer, composed of an off-line calibration phase and an on-line real-time identification and tracking phase. Then, the strategic layer is detailed, which is based on the information passed from the vision layer and the stored information about the soccer domain. It decides the robot actions to be executed, given in terms of velocity and navigation direction. Finally, we give an overall description of the hardware architecture used. At FIRA'98 Games, held in Paris, France, The GUARANA team performed well, and won the worldwide vice-championship in the MIROSOT category (Micro-Robot Soccer Tournament).

AB  - This work proposes an interaction between a heat transfer model and an artificial intelligence (AI) heuristic search method which is linked to a Knowledge Basis for the optimization of a Laser Transformation Hardening (LTH) process. The developed computational program selects the best combinations of laser operational variables for the highest martensitic production and for laser energy saving. The mathematical model consists on an analytical part to describe the workpiece laser heating and a numerical part for the cooling process. The Knowledge Basis is a rule-based system constituted of heat treatment constraints. The use of the developed search method for determining optimized laser operational variables can be considered a very effective tool in the improvement of the LTH process performance.

AB  - There is a difference between rules and principles in Law Argumentation Theory. The conflict of rules is solved by meta-rules like Lex Superior (based in general hierarchical structure of legal system), Lex Posterior (based on later rule priority), Lex Specialis (based on specification of rules) and also by exceptions, which exclude the conflict. The collisions of rules imply the validity negation of one rule. However, this does not occur in a collision of principles. Even when one principle is not applied by collisions, its validity remains. Another point is that the priority could change, changing the overridden principle. So, it is necessary to build a reasoning model that allows reasoning with conflicting legal principles. Another problem is vagueness of principles. Vagueness does not mean just an imprecise meaning, linguistically talking. There should be attributed a semantic, or a pragmatic meaning. Vagueness of principles occurs on account of its opened antecedent, with no established conduct. In this paper a model of reasoning using Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Law methods is described aiming at treating vagueness and collisions of principles, searching to establish rationality in legal argumentation systems. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Since there is no individual approach that can be universally applied to effectively solve the hard problems of artificial intelligence and data analysis, hybrid systems are necessary to better tackle specific tasks by exploiting the advantages of different methodologies in a single framework. Based on known results of combining neural networks and rule-based systems, this work presents a hybrid system with the purpose of simplifying rule sets obtained from rule induction algorithms on classification problems without increasing the accuracy error. This is motivated by assuming that simplicity can lead to more understandable models and rule induction algorithms often provide an excessive number of rules necessary to classify future examples within a given accuracy error, even after pruning. Experimental evidence suggests effective gains on a benchmark of sixteen data sets. Experiments were also performed to detect the effect of different components of the proposed approach in achieving the results and so helping to explain why this hybrid system works. © 2001-IOS Press.

AB  - An artificial neural network with a two-layer feedback topology and generalized recurrent neurons, for solving nonlinear discrete dynamic optimization problems, is developed. A direct method to assign the weights of neural networks is presented. The method is based on Bellmann's Optimality Principle and on the interchange of information which occurs during the synaptic chemical processing among neurons. The neural network based algorithm is an advantageous approach for dynamic programming due to the inherent parallelism of the neural networks; further it reduces the severity of computational problems that can occur in methods like conventional methods. Some illustrative application examples are presented to show how this approach works out including the shortest path and fuzzy decision making problems.

AB  - The appropriate operation of a radial basis function (RBF) neural network depends mainly upon an adequate choice of the parameters of its basis functions. The simplest approach to train an RBF network is to assume fixed radial basis functions defining the activation of the hidden units. Once the RBF parameters are fixed, the optimal set of output weights can be determined straightforwardly by using a linear least squares algorithm, which generally means reduction in the learning time as compared to the determination of all RBF network parameters using supervised learning. The main drawback of this strategy is the requirement of an efficient algorithm to determine the number, position, and dispersion of the RBFs. The approach proposed here is inspired by models derived from the vertebrate immune system, that will be shown to perform unsupervised cluster analysis. The algorithm is introduced and its performance is compared to that of the random, k-means center selection procedures and other results from the literature. By automatically defining the number of RBF centers, their positions and dispersions, the proposed method leads to parsimonious solutions. Simulation results are reported concerning regression and classification problems.

AB  - The general interest in the web as a medium for sharing and distributing information has reached formal education. Recent literature has discussed several modalities of educational application for computer-mediated communication technologies. The use of these new technologies is not seen in the same proportion in the workplace. This work addresses the learning opportunities which the internet media can bring to the process of continual development of people at work. Particular reference is made to the design of the Dice Game, a multi-user synchronous simulation game for manufacturing training.

AB  - In a trading scenario agents Interact with each other, selling and buying resources. In order to control the behavior of the trading scenario, the interactions must be coordinated. We present a brief discussion of communication types and coordination models applicable in multi-agent systems. We find a programmable tuple space more appropriate to manage and rule the interactions between the trading agents. We discuss the advantages of a trading agent model that deals with the trading strategy, concentrating on what to buy or sell. This relieves the agent from the task of coordinating the negotiations and their revoking or acceptances. This is the task of the programmable tuple space.

AB  - This paper describes research investigating the evolution of coordination strategies in robot soccer teams. Each player (viewed as an agent) is provided with a common set of skills and is assigned to perform over a delimited area inside a soccer field. The idea is to optimize the whole team behavior by means of a spatial coadaptation process in which new players are selected in such a way to comply with the already existing ones. The main results show that, through coevolution, we progressively create teams whose members act on complementary areas of the playing field, being capable of prevailing over a standard opponent team with a fixed formation. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of cognitive character animation. We propose the use of finite state machines for the behavioral control of characters. Our approach rests on the idea that the cognitive character arises from the evolutionary computation embedded in the artificial life simulation, which in our case is implemented by the finite state machine. We present some of the results of the WOXBOT/ARENA research project. This project to build virtual worlds is aimed at the graphic simulation of an arena, where small mobile robots can perform requested tasks while behaving according to their own motivation and reasoning. Each robot is an intelligent agent that perceives the virtual environment through a simulated vision system and reacts by moving away from or approaching the object it sees. The conception and specification of the robots and environment are being done very carefully to create an open distributed object architecture that could serve as a test-bed freely available and ready to use for testing theories in some computational areas such as evolutionary computation, artificial life, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, cognitive neurosciences and distributed objects architectures. Furthermore, it is a first step towards building a cognitive animated character. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The rule-based approach from traditional AI and the conventional constraint satisfaction algorithms are not adequate to cope with the unpredictable events and interactive computations in distributed CAD environments. This paper claims that the problems faced by distributed CAD systems require solutions based on the concepts of emergence, reactivity, and online algorithms. The present paper presents Extended Constraints Graphs (ECGs) as online algorithms supporting emergence in a network of reactive agents. ECGs represent an effective solution for the nonlinear constraint problem in cyclic graphs, which are distributed over a heterogeneous computer network. The relationships between agents in an ECG are generic, distributed, recursive and nonlinear - a problem not solved in the literature. Also this paper presents a CORBA model integrated with a Geometry Bus to support distributed virtual prototype whose variables can be defined in terms of ECGs. © 2001 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This work proposes an interaction between a numerical heat transfer model and an artificial intelligence (AI) heuristic search method which is linked to a Knowledge Base for the continuous casting of quality billets (SAE 1010 steel). A two-dimensional heat transfer model was developed using a finite difference method and was applied to real dimensions of a steel billet continuous caster. The Knowledge Base consists of technological and metallurgical constraints. The heuristic search method, aided by the Knowledge Base, explores the space parameter settings in order to find optimized cooling conditions which results in defect free billet production with minimum metallurgical length. The use of the developed search method for determining optimum setting of cooling conditions demonstrated that very good results can be attained in assuring billet quality and in the improvement of caster performance.

AB  - This article is about applications that can be customized or extended through their own user interface. This is achieved by the interface's ability to interpret users' non-literal expressions, namely metaphorical and metonymic ones. Such increased interpretive intelligence depends on static and dynamic models of the domain and application, from which new figurative meanings are abducted automatically or semi-automatically. The system performs controlled modifications on the underlying models, based on inferences it draws about users' intentions as they produce figurative utterances.

AB  - An unsupervised neural network is proposed to learn and recall complex robot trajectories. Two cases are considered: (i) A single trajectory in which a particular arm configuration (state) may occur more than once, and (ii) trajectories sharing states with each other. Ambiguities occur in both cases during recall of such trajectories. The proposed model consists of two groups of synaptic weights trained by competitive and Hebbian learning laws. They are responsible for encoding spatial and temporal features of the input sequences, respectively. Three mechanisms allow the network to deal with repeated or shared states: local and global context units, neurons disabled from learning, and redundancy. The network reproduces the current and the next state of the learned sequences and is able to resolve ambiguities. The model was simulated over various sets of robot trajectories in order to evaluate learning and recall, trajectory sampling effects and robustness.

AB  - This work presents a hybrid expert system (HES) intended to minimise some complex problems pervasive to knowledge engineering such as: the knowledge elicitation process, known as the bottleneck of expert systems; the choice of a model for knowledge representation to codify human reasoning; the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the topology used in the connectionist approach; the difficulty to extract an explanation from the network. Two algorithms applied to developing of HES are also suggested. One of them is used to train the fuzzy neural network and the other to obtain explanations on how the fuzzy neural network attained a conclusion. A case study is presented (e.g. epileptic crisis) with the inclusion of problem definition and simulations. The results are also discussed. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - It is difficult to control and to manage the start-up of a petroleum offshore platform. In order to solve this problem an intelligent system can play an important role, since available qualitative operator and design knowledge can be easily implemented to assist the operator during start-up. This paper describes the integration of an expert system with a fuzzy controller applied to such a process. The intelligent system has many heuristic rules to implement the automation of the start-up procedures, like the opening of many on-off valves while simultaneously monitoring process variables. It also has a fuzzy controller to optimize the opening of the oil wells, in order to minimize the start-up time. This intelligent system is being implemented in the platform P-19 of Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company, in Campos Basin, Brazil. The prototype has been operating since October 1998. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper proposes a hybrid expert system (HES) to minimise some complexity problems pervasive to the artificial intelligence such as: the knowledge elicitation process, known as the bottleneck of expert systems; the model choice for knowledge representation to code human reasoning; the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the topology used in the connectionist approach; the difficulty to obtain the explanation on how the network arrived to a conclusion. Two algorithms applied to developing of HES are also suggested. One of them is used to train the fuzzy neural network and the other to obtain explanations on how the fuzzy neural network attained a conclusion. To overcome these difficulties the cognitive computing was integrated to the developed system. A case study is presented (e.g. epileptic crisis) with the problem definition and simulations. Results are also discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article describes an approach to an Intelligent Tutorial System - CARDIOLOG, specially developed to help in teaching electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation to medical students. Although the system can be used as a self-learning tool, one of its main characteristics is the adequacy to classroom environment - a Professor module and many Student's modules. Medical students and professors, physicians and people interested on the subject will be able to form a solid knowledge base or complement their studies with CARDIOLOG. The activities rely on user-friendly interfaces, based on the questions/answers model, with the possibility of consulting reference (if enabled by the professor). Analysis of students' performance, reports and knowledge base maintenance tools are also available in CARDIOLOG. CARDIOLOG was implemented using Artificial Intelligence technologies, development using object methodology, Client/Server structure, 32-bit Windows platform.

AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to present a procedure that utilizes 13C NMR for pattern recognition and substructure elucidation of monoterpenes. By this reason, a novel version of the REGRAS program was developed for the specialist SISTEMAT system. This program carries out an analysis of the 13C NMR data from a given compound and, from characteristic chemical shift ranges, recognizes the substructures and the skeleton present in a compound. At the end of this procedure, the program displays as analysis results the likely skeletons and substructures of the substance in question. The REGRAS program was tested on skeleton elucidation of 30 monoterpenes from the most varied skeleton types, exhibiting excellent results in skeleton and substructure prediction processes.

AB  - Load forecasting has become in recent years one of the major areas of research in electrical engineering, and most traditional forecasting models and artificial intelligence techniques have been tried out in this task. Artificial neural networks (NNs) have lately received much attention, and a great number of papers have reported successful experiments and practical tests with them. Nevertheless, some authors remain skeptical, and believe that the advantages of using NNs in forecasting have not been systematically proved yet. In order to investigate the reasons for such skepticism, this review examines a collection of papers (published between 1991 and 1999) that report the application of NNs to short-term load forecasting. Our aim is to help to clarify the issue, by critically evaluating the ways in which the NNs proposed in these papers were designed and tested.

AB  - This paper reports the development of a powerful and versatile laboratory for vision research, namely Σynergos, which has been developed and implemented under Delphi/Windows in a distributed systems of microcomputers. The main paradigm underlying the whole approach consists in integrating several concepts and techniques into a single computing environment, i.e. Σynergos, in such a way that the requisites and possibilities of each of the constituent components complement one another and the thus obtained result becomes greater than the sum of its parts. The components of Σynergos include distributed system capabilities and a number of libraries containing algorithms for: computer vision, modeling and simulation of biological visual systems, data and classification analysis, software validation and comparative evaluation, Internet, off-the-shelf application, image databases, artificial intelligence, data mining, and visualization resources. In this paper special emphasis is placed upon the Internet, distributed implementation and biological vision. After outlining the principal requisites and potentials underlying each of such components, some specific situations of interest arising from the integration of two or more of such elements are described and discussed. Details concerning the integration with Internet and the implementation of the laboratory as a distributed system are provided, and a complete case-example is presented. This applications regards the implementation of a psychophysical experiment aimed at investigating human perception of pictorial complexity, including the derivation of a mathematic-computational framework modeling such a perception as well as the use of the Internet as a source of stimuli and for reporting the obtained results. In addition, the mathematic-computational model is derived by using a parallel version of the genetic algorithm running on the distributed system of PCs. The obtained encouraging results substantiate the potential of this vision laboratory for multidisciplinary vision research.

AB  - Radiographic inspection is widely used in non-destructive testing for integrity evaluation of structures and equipments, especially for detection and characterisation of defects in welded joints. For this reason, research to optimise this technique has been increasing in recent years. As it is a technique that demands the inspector's vast experience and correct adjustment of inspection parameters, in many situations the final decision becomes a difficult task and subject to interpretation mistakes. With the progress of computer science and techniques of artificial intelligence and neural computation, efforts in several countries have been made seeking the development of an automatic system of inspection for X-rays or gamma-rays that optimises the interpretation of welding defects. This work presents a way to obtain the best hierarchical and non-hierarchical linear discriminators for classification of the principal welding defects, using a neural network technique for implementation. The results prove the efficiency of the techniques used in the work.

AB  - Nowadays, it is very important for retail companies to understand their customers and establish a good relationship with them. It is then crucial to be able to segment the customers according to their buying patterns and needs. Unfortunately, this is not an easy task, requiring the consideration of several different mathematical techniques. In this work, a database from a long distance telephone company containing client-calling patterns was clustered and characterized. First, the Kohonen algorithm was used to cluster a subset of the database. Then, the clusters extracted were characterized using rules and some statistical visualization techniques. Finally, a classification model, based on neural networks, was built to classify future customers into the clusters extracted.

AB  - Artificial neural networks (ANN) were used as the alternative procedure for the risk assessment of power systems. The approach was found to be useful where the exchange of information among utilities might be subjected to hindrances due to conflict of interests, time constraints or lack of data. The suggested technique was able to evaluate risk indices in a per bus basis. The procedure also exhibited excellent results during the estimation of expected energy not supplied (EENS).

AB  - We introduce a global optimization procedure, the neural-assisted genetic algorithm (NAGA). It combines the power of an artificial neural network (ANN) with the versatility of the genetic algorithm. This method is suitable to solve optimization problems that depend on some kind of heuristics to limit the search space. If a reasonable amount of data is available, the ANN can “understand” the problem and provide the genetic algorithm with a selected population of elements that will speed up the search for the optimum solution. We tested the method in a search for the ground-state geometry of silicon clusters. We trained the ANN with information about the geometry and energetics of small silicon clusters. Next, the ANN learned how to restrict the configurational space for larger silicon clusters. For [Formula Presented] and [Formula Presented] we noticed that the NAGA is at least three times faster than the “pure” genetic algorithm. As the size of the cluster increases, it is expected that the gain in terms of time will increase as well. 5555 2002 The American Physical Society.

AB  - We present a new approach to design fault tolerant artificial neural networks (ANNs). Additionally, this approach allows estimating the final network reliability. This approach is based on the mutation analysis technique and is used during the training process of the ANN. The basic idea is to train the ANN in the presence of faults (single-fault model is assumed). To do so, a set of faults is injected into the code describing the ANN. This procedure yields mutation versions of the original ANN code, which in turn are used to train the network in an iterative process with the designer until the moment when the ANN is no longer sensible to the single faults injected. In other words, the network became tolerant to the considered set of faults. A practical example where an ANN is used to recognize an electrocardiogram (ECG) and to measure ECG parameters illustrates the proposed methodology. © 2000 IEEE.

AB  - Text categorization is a process of classifying documents with regard to a group of one or more existent categories according to themes or concepts present in their contents. The most common application of it is in information retrieval systems (IRS) to document indexing. A method to transform text categorization into a viable task is to use machine-learning algorithms to automate text classification, allowing it to be carried out fast, into concise manner and in broad range. The objective of this work is to present and compare the results of experiments on text categorization using artificial neural networks of multilayer perceptron and self-organizing map types, and traditional machine-learning algorithms used in this task: C4.5 decision tree, PART decision rules and Naive Bayes classifier. © 2002 IEEE.

AB  - We introduce a translation of a conditional logic semantics to a mathematical programming problem. A model of 0-1 programming is used to compute the logical consequences of a conditional knowledge base, according to a chosen default theory semantics. The key to understanding this model of mathematical programming is to regard the task of the entailment of plausible conclusions as isomorphic to an instance of weighted MAX-SAT problem. Hence, we describe the use of combinatorial optimization algorithms in the task of defeasible reasoning over conditional knowledge bases. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.

AB  - Extracting meaningful knowledge from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is a current issue since, for several applications, the ability to explain the decisions taken by ANNs is even more important than their classification performance. Although some techniques have been suggested to solve this problem, a large number of these techniques can only be applied to some specific ANNs models. This paper proposes and investigates the use of symbolic learning algorithms, such as C.45, C4.5rules [13], and CN2 [4], to extract meaningful symbolic representations from trained ANNs. The main difference of this approach with other techniques previously proposed is that it can be applied to any supervised ANN model. The approach proposed is in some way similar to the one used by the Trepan algorithm [5], which extracts a symbolic representation, expressed as a decision tree, from a trained ANN. Experimental results are presented and discussed in order to compare the knowledge extracted from several ANNs using the proposed approach and the Trepan approach. Results are compared regarding two aspects: fidelity and comprehensibility. The results obtained show that our approach, using C4.5, C4.5rules and CN2 as symbolic learning algorithms, produces in general better comprehensible symbolic representation than Trepan for the trained ANNs considered in the experiments. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.

AB  - This paper describes a multiagent system for natural language processing that deals with task oriented dialogue processing in Portuguese. The system is based on Discourse Structure Theory, on Centering Theory and on Lochbaum?s work on modeling the Intentional Structure of the discourse. The dialogue takes place between the user and the system in such a way that the user plays the role of one participant and the system plays the other. Together, both the system and the user collaborate to achieve the goal the user had in mind when he/she initiated the dialogue. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.

AB  - In this paper we address the problem of multi-objective attribute selection in data mining. We propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) based on the wrapper approach to discover the best subset of attributes for a given classification algorithm, namely C4.5, a well-known decision-tree algorithm. The two objectives to be minimized are the error rate and the size of the tree produced by C4.5. The proposed GA is a multi-objective method in the sense that it discovers a set of non-dominated solutions (attribute subsets), according to the concept of Pareto dominance. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.

AB  - This paper presents an architecture for distributed control systems and its underlying methodological framework. Ideas and concepts of distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and soft computing are merged into a unique architecture to provide cooperation, flexibility, and adaptability required by knowledge processing in intelligent control systems. The distinguished features of the architecture include a local problem solving capability to handle the specific requirements of each part of the system, an evolutionary case-based mechanism to improve performance and optimize controls, the use of linguistic variables as means for information aggregation, and fuzzy set theory to provide local control. A distributed traffic control system application is discussed to provide the details of the architecture, and to emphasize its usefulness. The performance of the distributed control system is compared with conventional control approaches under a variety of traffic situations. © 2002 KSAE.

AB  - This paper evaluates the performance of three popular technologies used to interconnect machines on clusters: Fast Ethernet, Myrinet and Giganet. To achieve this purpose, we used the NAS Parallel Benchmarks. Surprisingly, for the LU application, the performance of Fast Ethernet was better than Myrinet. We also evaluate the performance gains provided by VIA, a user lever communication protocol, when compared with TCP/IP, a traditional, stacked-based communication protocol. The impacts caused by the use of Remote DMA Write are also evaluated. The results show that Fast Ethernet, when combined with a high performance communication protocol, such as VIA, has a good cost-benefit ratio, and can be a good choice to connect machines on a small cluster environment where bandwidth is not crucial for applications. © 2002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this paper, the ambient temperature values and load signals are applied in an architecture of artificial neural network with the objective of estimating the internal temperature of oil-immersed distribution transformers. The architecture of neural network used in this application is a multilayer perceptron. The training of the network was carried-out using the "Resilient Propagation" algorithm and it was based on design details and experimental data relative to the oil-immersed distribution transformers. Simulation results of the proposed approach indicate that this methodology can be efficiently used in the protection processes of transformers, increasing the selectivity, reliability and the management of the electric energy distribution system.

AB  - The use of Fuzzy Logic to solve control problems have been increasing considerably in the past years. The successfulness of fuzzy application depends on a number of parameters, such as fuzzy membership functions, that are usually decided upon subjectively. One way to improve the performance of the fuzzy reasoning model is the use of genetic algorithm. In this paper it is shown that a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm learning mechanism, supplements the performance of fuzzy reasoning model. The PSO is able to generate an optimal set of parameters for fuzzy reasoning model based on either, their initial subjective selection, or on a random selection. The purpose of this paper is to present and discuss a strategy for the membership functions automatic adjustment, using PSO algorithms, and presents an application designed to park a vehicle into a garage, beginning from any start position.

AB  - The simulation technique has been used to solve many problems that occur in the production process. Whenever an event occurs, many alternatives (scenarios) can be generated in order to solve the problem. However, as much as the number of scenarios to be simulated becomes higher, the time spent in this process raises, implicating in a difficult task to find a good solution. Hence, it is necessary to reduce this number of scenarios. In this context, it is proposed an approach to reduce the number of scenarios to be simulated, grouping similar scenarios in sets, through the use of fuzzy logic.

AB  - The task of controlling urban traffic requires flexibility, adaptability, and handling of uncertain information spread through the urban network. The use of fuzzy sets, case-based mechanisms, and genetic algorithms in a distributed system framework can provide the necessary foundations for an efficient and adaptable on-line traffic control system. In this paper we present a distributed traffic control system built upon a fuzzy, adaptive framework. A traffic network consisting of 16 traffic lights in six intersections was implemented and compared with conventional traffic control approaches. Simulation results show that the distributed system outperforms current traffic engineering strategies.

AB  - An overview is given on the possibility of controlling the status of circuit breakers (CB) in a substations with the use of a knowledge base that relates some of the operation magnitudes, mixing status variables with time variables and fuzzy sets. It is shown that even when all the magnitudes to be controlled cannot be included in the analysis, it is possible to control the desired status while supervising some important magnitudes as the voltage, power factor, and harmonic distortion, as well as the present status.

AB  - This paper reports on the development of an economic market simulator using mobile agents. Agents are specialized software programs that can move autonomously between supporting platforms. Agents can be used to model the preferences of users wishing to buy or sell items on a global marketplace. Users can select a number of options that will guide the agents in their quest for an optimal trade. Besides the price range, users can determine the way in which the agents will bargain, thus fine-tuning the tradeoffs involved in deciding whether a price in the price range requires further negotiation or is acceptable. The simulation developed is realized entirely in Java, and takes advantage of TEEMA, an extensible, general-purpose mobile agent execution environment, dedicated to the purpose of exploring the capabilities of mobile agents. TEEMA has been realized to provide a testbed for agent applications without having to be limited by proprietary application suites or inaccessible low-level interfaces. It is completely configurable and easily extensible as it is built around a microkernel that supports primitive agent operations and a set of services that provide high-level agent support. The paper starts with the description of the infrastructure necessary to define a marketplace as a combination of service agents. Then, trader agents are explained. The simulation environment is then introduced, and analyzed. The architecture emerging from the simulation environment is then examined, together with its advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the simulation parameters are presented. An analysis of the results shows that the simulation environment can provide a suitable platform for economic simulation based on empirical analysis or more formal systems such as game theory. An example of asymmetric transaction is presented where it is shown that trades are influenced by the agent initiating the transaction.

AB  - In this work is presented a new proposal for solving the reactive power dispatch. The approach is based on the (μ + λ)-ES paradigm improved by the control of mutations and by using of Cauchy-based mutation rather than the classical Gaussian Mutations (GMs). Others variants are also implemented and a comparative study are performed. Good and reliable performance have been achieved and validation tests using the standard IEEE118 system are reported. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Shrinkage occurs In all polymers, being extremely dependent on processing conditions. The utilization of shrinkage data allows designers to accurately predict the final part dimensions. A numerical prediction of a part shrinkage can be made using simulation packages available commercially. However, this shrinkage is highly dependent on the non-linear material behavior and, thus, its estimation involves significant simplifications. On the other hand, artificial neural networks, ANN, can model highly non-linear systems; thus, it is expected that they can predict a part shrinkage effectively. In this study, a neural network architecture was developed to predict the shrinkage of an iPP injection molded plaque after changing four processing conditions: melt and mold temperatures, holding pressure and flow rate. The experiments were defined through the use of the design of experiments. A simulation code, Moldflow®, was used to establish the processing window; its shrinkage predictions were compared with experimental, neural network and statistical results. It was observed that the ANN had the best performance in the shrinkage prediction, even using limited experimental data, confirming its great capacity to model non-linear systems.

AB  - The productivity and quality of a continuous caster depend mainly on process parameters, i.e. casting speed, casting temperature, steel composition and cleanliness of the melt, water flow rates in the different cooling zones, etc. This work presents the development of an algorithm, which incorporates heuristic search techniques for direct application in metallurgical industries, particularly those using continuous casting process for the production of steel billets and slabs. This is done to determine the casting objectives of maximum casting rate as a function of casting constraints. These constraints are evaluated with the aid of a heat transfer and solidification model based on the finite difference technique, which has been developed and integrated with a genetic algorithm. The essential parts of continuous casting equipment, which must be subjected to monitoring, as well as a methodology of mathematical model and physical settlements in each cooling region, are presented. The efficiency of the intelligent system is assured by the optimisation of the continuous casting operation by maximum casting rate and defect-free products. This approach is applied to the real dimension of a steel continuous caster, in real conditions of operation, demonstrating that good results can be attained by using heuristic search, such as: smaller temperature gradients between sprays zones, reduction in water consumption and an increase in casting speed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Mutation testing (Mutation Analysis), although powerful in revealing faults, is considered a computationally expensive criterion, due to the high number of mutants created and the effort to determine the equivalent mutants. Using mutation-based alternative testing criteria it is possible to reduce the number of mutants but it is still necessary to determine the equivalent ones. In this paper the Bayesian Learning (one of the Artificial Intelligence techniques used in machine learning) is investigated to define the Bayesian Learning-Based Equivalent Detection Technique (BaLBEDeT), which provides guidelines to help the tester to analyze the live mutants in order to determine the equivalent ones.

AB  - Traditional methods for data mining typically make the assumption that data is centralized and static. This assumption is no longer tenable. Such methods waste computational and I/O resources when the data is dynamic, and they impose excessive communication overhead when the data is distributed. As a result, the knowledge discovery process is harmed by slow response times. Efficient implementation of incremental data mining ideas in distributed computing environments is thus becoming crucial for ensuring scalability and facilitating knowledge discovery when data is dynamic and distributed. In this paper we address this issue in the context of frequent itemset mining, an important data mining task. Frequent itemsets are most often used to generate correlations and association rules, but more recently they have been used in such far-reaching domains as bio-informatics and e-commerce applications. We first present an efficient algorithm which dynamically maintains the required information in the presence of data updates without examining the entire dataset. We then show how to parallelize the incremental algorithm, so that it can asynchronously mine frequent itemsets. We also propose a distributed algorithm, which imposes low communication overhead for mining distributed datasets. Several experiments confirm that our algorithm results in excellent execution time improvements. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - In this article we present a case study comparison of the implementation characteristics of two software environments that are well known in grid computing configurations. We evaluate the performance of these environments during the execution of distributed parallel MPI tasks. Therefore, first we consider some concepts of the grid paradigm and then we present a comparison between the two software environments. Our case study is based on the Globus and Legion environments, because these two research projects are in more developed stage when compared to others research initiatives. Our experimental results indicate that the grid computing approach can be interesting to execute distributed parallel MPI applications with a performance improvement. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - This paper presents a language designed for the description of both temporal schema versioning and schema modification in object-oriented databases. The language supports temporal and versions features in both schemata and data levels. An extension of the ODMG standard is presented in order to incorporate temporal and versioning features into ODL language to properly manage the schema evolution mechanism. Thus, this proposal improves the database environment with temporal and versioning features concerning database modification. The solution to the problem is shown to be feasible since it is defined in terms of the ODMG standard. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - A tester relies on some sort of contract between the users and the implementers of a system. The contract defines the obligations of each part that are partially checked by selecting and executing test-cases. In fact, these test-cases are contracts, too, although in a rather operational form. In this article we define the general relationship between these two forms of contract and present a method how various test-selection strategies can be defined formally. More precisely, we demonstrate how test-cases can be calculated from contracts using a refinement calculus. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Pairing-based cryptosystems depend on the existence of groups where the Decision Diffie-Hellman problem is easy to solve, but the Computational Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. Such is the case of elliptic curve groups whose embedding degree is large enough to maintain a good security level, but small enough for arithmetic operations to be feasible. However, the embedding degree for most elliptic curves is enormous, and the few previously known suitable elliptic curves have embedding degree k ≤ 6. In this paper, we examine criteria for curves with larger k that generalize prior work by Miyaji et al. based on the properties of cyclotomic polynomials, and propose efficient representations for the underlying algebraic structures. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Since little is still known about fundamental brain mechanisms associated to thought, its different manifestations are usually classified in an oversimplified way into normal and abnormal, like delusional and disorganized thought or creative thinking. Considering dopaminergic signal-to-noise neuronal modulation in the central nervous system, and the existence of semantic maps in the human brain, we developed a self-organizing neural network model to unify different thought processes into a single neurocomputational substrate. We performed simulations varying dopaminergic modulation and observed the total patterns that emerged at the resulting semantic map, assuming that these correspond to thought. The model thus shows how normal and abnormal thinking are generated, and that there are no clear borders between their different manifestations. Actually, a continuum of different qualitative reasoning, ranging from delusion to disorganized thought, and passing through normal and creative thinking, seems to be more plausible. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Different splitting techniques are applied in the context of semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit approach to develop computationally efficient scheme. Vertical decoupling permits to apply simpler explicit calculations for slow vertical modes and transforms the 3D elliptic equation arising on each time step of the scheme to a set of 2D elliptic problems. By time splitting, the last are reduced to 1D problems, which admit an efficient direct solver. Finally, the space splitting diminishes the amount of operations due to approximation of the physically insignificant terms with lower order of accuracy. Application of these techniques results in an efficient scheme with time step chosen according to accuracy consideration and the amount of calculations proportional to the number of spatial grid points. Performed numerical experiments show good computational performance of the algorithm and accuracy of forecasting meteorological fields. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Agent technology is a new approach of Distributed Artificial Intelligence to implement autonomous entities driven by beliefs, goals, capabilities and plans, and other agency properties such as adaptation, interaction, and mobility. Software agents are the focus of considerable research in the artificial intelligence community, but not much has been done in the field of software engineering. In this paper, we present an object-oriented framework for building software agents in a distributed environment. The design of the framework also allows an easy mapping of the models developed in the analysis and design phase of the Gaia Methodology to object-oriented code. We believe that object-oriented framework technology can reduce not only the development time but also the complexity of implementing multi-agent systems. We present an instantiated application that uses this framework to illustrate an implementation.

AB  - This work presents the idea and a prototype of workflow systems defined through constraints. We think that in many domain areas, such as health care, workflow systems are too inflexible. One does not know in advance what activities does the patient has to go through. Actually a new form of interaction with the workflow is needed, in which a controller asks the systems which precondition activities are necessary in order to execute a target activity and schedule the target activity. We also present Tucupi, a prototype of such constraint based WFMS. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Automatic learning techniques stand as promising tools to respond to the need of higher efficiency of traffic network, even more so at times of mounting pressure from economic and energy markets. To this end, this paper looks into the operation of a traffic network with distributed, intelligent agents. In particular, it casts the task of operating a traffic network as a distributed, stochastic game in which the agents solve reinforcement-learning problems. Results from computational experiments show that these agents can yield substantial gains with respect to the performance achieved by two other control policies for traffic lights. The paper ends with an outline of future research to deploy machine-learning technology in real-world traffic networks. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the current state of fuzzy logic theory in epidemioloy, which is a recent area of research. We present four applications of fuzzy logic theory in epidemic problems, using linguistic fuzzy models, possibility measure, probability of fuzzy events and fuzzy decision making techniques. The results demonstrate that the applications of fuzzy sets in epidemiology is a very promising area of research. The final discussion sets the future stage of fuzzy sets application in epidemiology. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, a refinement calculus called ZRC has been proposed for Z; it follows the style and conventions of the Z notation and is completely formalised. As any other formal technique, however, it needs tool support to be of practical use. In this paper, we present such a tool, which we call ZRC-Refine. It is an interactive tool, whose design makes it distinctively user-friendly. We believe that ZRC-Refine is a significant encouragement to the extended application of ZRC and of Z itself. © Springer-Verlag 2003.

AB  - There are several ways for an intruder to obtain access to a remote computing system, such as exploiting program vulnerabilities, stealing passwords, and so. The intruder can modify system utilities in order to hide his/her presence and to guarantee an open backdoor to the system. Many techniques have been proposed to detect unauthorized file modifications, but they usually work off-line and thus detect file modifications only when the system is already compromised. This paper presents an architecture to deal with this kind of problem. Through the combined use of digital signature techniques and system call interceptions, it allows for transparent on-the-fly integrity check of files in Unix systems. Its evaluation in real-world situations validates the approach, by showing overheads under 10% for most situations. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - This paper outlines the activities and objectives of process and process control audits, aiming at the implementation of advanced process control systems (ACSs) on existing mineral processing plants. Advanced process control systems - also referred to as online optimizing process control systems (OOPCSs) - is a relatively new technology that has been successfully applied to mineral processing plants worldwide with the aim of improving product quality; increasing throughput and recoveries; and reducing power consumption, variability, reagent consumption and operating costs in general. After a brief review of the concepts supporting advanced process control, the phases of their implementation are presented and the initial process and control audits are positioned therein. A detailed view of these audits, their role and the activities thereof, are then presented.

AB  - Neural oscillation is one of the most extensively investigated topics of artificial neural networks. Scientific approaches to the functionalities of both natural and artificial intelligences are strongly related to mechanisms underlying oscillatory activities. This paper concerns itself with the assumption of the existence of central pattern generators (CPGs), which are the plausible neural architectures with oscillatory capabilities, and presents a discrete and generalized approach to the functionality of locomotor CPGs of legged animals. Based on scheduling by multiple edge reversal (SMER), a primitive and deterministic distributed algorithm, it is shown how oscillatory building block (OBB) modules can be created and, hence, how OBB-based networks can be formulated as asymmetric Hopfield-like neural networks for the generation of complex coordinated rhythmic patterns observed among pairs of biological motor neurons working during different gait patterns. It is also shown that the resulting Hopfield-like network possesses the property of reproducing the whole spectrum of different gaits intrinsic to the target locomotor CPGs. Although the new approach is not restricted to the understanding of the neurolocomotor system of any particular animal, hexapodal and quadrupedal gait patterns are chosen as illustrations given the wide interest expressed by the ongoing research in the area.

AB  - AMPLIA is a multi-agent intelligent learning environment designed to support training of diagnostic reasoning and modelling of domains with complex and uncertain knowledge. AMPLIA focuses on the medical area. It is a system that deals with uncertainty under the Bayesian network approach, where learner-modelling tasks will consist of creating a Bayesian network for a problem the system will present. The construction of a network involves qualitative and quantitative aspects. The qualitative part concerns the network topology, that is, causal relations among the domain variables. After it is ready, the quantitative part is specified. It is composed of the distribution of conditional probability of the variables represented. A negotiation process (managed by an intelligent MediatorAgent) will treat the differences of topology and probability distribution between the model the learner built and the one built-in in the system. That negotiation process occurs between the agents that represent the expert knowledge domain (DomainAgent) and the agent that represents the learner knowledge (LearnerAgent). © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - We propose a kind of Bak-Sneppen dynamics as a general optimization technique to treat magnetic systems. The resulting dynamics shows self-organized criticality with power-law scaling of the spatial and temporal correlations. An alternative method of the extremal optimization (EO) is also analyzed here. We provided a numerical confirmation that, for any possible value of its free parameter τ, the EO dynamics exhibits a non-critical behavior with an infinite spatial range and exponential decay of the avalanches. Using the chiral clock model as our test system, we compare the efficiency of the two dynamics with regard to their abilities to find the system's ground state. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The goal of this study is the neural network modeling of two performance variables of Kraft recovery boilers: production of superheated steam and ratio of the generated steam flow rate to the amount of dry solids feed to the boiler. Several physical and chemical phenomena occur simultaneously in these equipments, which play a fundamental role in the Kraft chemical process for wood pulping. Therefore, it is important to understand all relationships among operational variables involved in combustion, reduction, oxidation, and heat transfer process that take place in the boiler. Neural network technique has been applied in this work due to its non-linear modeling capability, difficulties so far found for complete mathematical description of all phenomena occurring in these equipments, and large amount of interest data available at a Brazilian industrial unit. Due to the predominance of non-linear phenomena in chemical process, the potential for application of neural network methods in simulation and control of industrial chemical process is considerably large. In fact, this branch of artificial intelligence research field has grown as much in academic studies as in applications around the world. As a final output of this study, correlation coefficients (r) have been calculated to determine the efficiency of neural network models in predicting Kraft boiler behavior for the interest variables. This parameter measures the degree of linear association between the model theoretical predictions and those measured experimentally. For steam generation model results, r has been determined to be 0.972 and, for the amount of produced steam per ton of feed dry solids, it is equal to 0.907. These values attest the predictive ability of the neural description and the use of the technique to model the interest variable of recovery Kraft boilers.

AB  - Power system restoration (PSR) has been a subject of study for many years. In recent years, many techniques were proposed to solve the limitations of the predetermined restoration guidelines and procedures used by a majority of system operators to restore a system following the occurrence of a wide area disturbance. This paper discusses limitations encountered in some currently used PSR techniques and a proposed improvement based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). The proposed scheme is tested on a 162-bus transmission system and compared with a breadth-search restoration scheme. The results indicate that the use of ANN in power system restoration is a feasible option that should be considered for real-time applications.

AB  - This work presents a synchronous collaborative graphical editor that implements a proposal of an awareness mechanism of a collaborative artifact evolution. The graphical editor allows real-time, highly interactive collaborative work, using the mask metaphor to help participants in creating new diagram versions without interrupting the interaction as also to provide awareness of the diagram versions created. This paper describes the mask metaphor, the collaborative editor that implements this metaphor and discusses a case study conducted with the use of the tool. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Traditional approaches to ecological modeling, based on mathematical equations, are hampered by the qualitative nature of ecological knowledge. In this article, we demonstrate that qualitative reasoning provides alternative and productive ways for ecologists to develop, organize, and implement models. We present a qualitative theory of population dynamics and use this theory to capture and simulate commonsense theories about population and community ecology. Advantages of this approach include the possibility of deriving relevant conclusions about ecological systems without numeric data; a compositional approach that enables the reusability of models representing partial behavior; the use of a rich vocabulary describing objects, situations, relations, and mechanisms of change; and the capability to provide causal interpretations of system behavior.

AB  - A multi-layer neural network is constructed to describe the thermal decomposition of rhodium acetate. Critical analysis of the residual, trained, interpolated and extrapolated errors, with the number of neurons, indicates the efficiency of the present approach, It was possible, within this framework, to improve the An model, with a better correlation between the results. A new value of the activation energy, Ea, and frequency factor, Z, are calculated for the decomposition process. Since the neural network is more precise than a particular model, the calculated values for these quantities are believed to be more precise. The computed values are Ea=194.0 kJ mol-1 and Z=5.23·1016s-1. The neural network eliminates the step to decide, among the available models, the one that best fit the data. An agreement up to four significant figures can be achieved even for data not used in the training process, both in the interpolated and extrapolated regions. This method suggests, therefore, an important alternative tool for the experimentalists. The present approach can also be adapted to other systems and to data in two dimensions.

AB  - Due to the continuous increase in energy demand, without the corresponding investment in generation and transmission capacity, power systems have been operating close to their limits. Thus, the use of tools for supporting the operation is essential in order to increase reliability, reducing the number and/or duration of non-programmable interruptions, optimizing the use of assets. Aiming to reduce the duration of interruptions, several research works have been published describing tools developed to support the fault diagnosis task. These tools would be used during real time operation, after contingencies with definitive interruptions before starting the restoration process. This paper discusses important aspects of the fault diagnosis problem and the techniques more frequently employed to model and tackle this problem.

AB  - Zipf’s law asserts that in all natural languages the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank. The significance, if any, of this result for language remains a mystery. Here we examine a null hypothesis for the distribution of word frequencies, a so-called discourse-triggered word choice model, which is based on the assumption that the more a word is used, the more likely it is to be used again. We argue that this model is equivalent to the neutral infinite-alleles model of population genetics and so the degeneracy of the different words composing a sample of text is given by the celebrated Ewens sampling formula [Theor. Pop. Biol. 3 87 1972], which we show to produce an exponential distribution of word frequencies. © 2004 The American Physical Society.

AB  - We present an open multiagent architecture for intelligent collaborative information systems based on the concepts of cognitive agents and machine learning. We assume a double hypothesis: (i) agents collaborate to reach their goals; (ii) agents can find and interact with other agents in a network. This assumption implies specialized services that have as functions: (a) relate the needs of user agents with the services of supplier agents; (b) integrate several answers in order to produce better results; (c) send regular notification to user agents about changes in the world. The location of such services depends on the architecture one adopts. We focus on the definition of architecture able to dynamically integrate new agents into the system. Thus, agents shall have machine learning capabilities inherited from a generic agent. An open architecture brings some benefits to the system performance such as adaptability, availability of services, incremental development and improvement of lifetime. System proactive capabilities may extend the knowledge human users have about the process. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In this paper we present a study comparing the performance of different systems found in the literature that perform the task of automatic text segmentation in sentences for English documents. We also show the difficulties found to adapt these systems to make them work with Portuguese documents and the results obtained after the adaptation. We analyzed two systems that use a machine learning approach: MxTerminator and Satz, and a customized system based on fixed rules expressed by Regular Expressions. The results achieved by the Satz system were surprisingly positive for Portuguese documents. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The regression-by-discretization approach allows the use of classification algorithm in a regression task. It works as a pre-processing step in which the numeric target value is discretized into a set of intervals. We had applied this approach to the Hidden Markov Model for Regression (HMMR) which was successfully compared to the Naive Bayes for Regression and two traditional forecasting methods, Box-Jenkins and Winters. In this work, to further improve these results, we apply three discretization methods to HMMR using ten time series data sets. The experimental results showed that one of the discretization methods improved the results in most of the data sets, although each method improved the results in at least one data set. Therefore, it would be better to have a search algorithm to automatically find the optimal number and width of the intervals. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The authors present and demonstrate an efficient method to estimate the bit error rate (BER) of turbo codes via a truncated importance sampling (TIS). The TIS method is based on the relevant code words that effectively contribute to the total BER. In order to find out these code words, a fast algorithm is proposed. Two examples are presented to describe the TIS method. The method is particularly effective at high signal to noise ratio (SNR), where Monte Carlo (MC) simulation takes too much time to obtain an estimative that is statistically sound. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - One of the main problems in using logic for solving problems is the high computational costs involved in inference. In this paper, we propose the use of a notion of relevance in order to cut the search space for a solution. Instead of trying to infer a formula a directly from a large knowledge base K, we consider first only the most relevant sentences in K for the proof. If those are not enough, the set can be increased until, at the worst case, we consider the whole base K. We show how to define a notion of relevance for first-order logic with equality and analyze the results of implementing the method and testing it over more than 700 problems from the TPTP problem library. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In the area of monitoring communication networks, GEDSystem is a tool for supporting the development of programs driven to the management of domains that may show up when networks are monitored by SNMP. This tool is supported by an automatic modeling of data and events and automates the grouping of MIB objects from several SNMP agents, producing data structures that represent Domains and Events. The structures are automatically transformed into Tables and Views of a relational database. The views implement the perception mechanisms of the Events defined in the tool. The GEDSystem also provides a Monitoring Agent that automatically recognizes, collects and stores information about the Domains. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In Data Mining, one of the steps of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, the use of concept hierarchies as a background knowledge allows to express the discovered knowledge in a higher abstraction level, more concise and usually in a more interesting format. However, data mining for high level concepts is more complex because the search space is generally too big. Some data mining systems require the database to be pre-generalized to reduce the space, what makes difficult to discover knowledge at arbitrary levels of abstraction. To efficiently induce high-level rules at different levels of generality, without pre-generalizing databases, fast access to concept hierarchies and fast query evaluation methods are needed. This work presents the NETUNO-HC system that performs induction of classification rules using concept hierarchies for the attributes values of a relational database, without pre-generalizing them or even using another tool to represent the hierarchies. It is showed how the abstraction level of the discovered rules can be affected by the adopted search strategy and by the relevance measures considered during the data mining step. Moreover, it is demonstrated by a series of experiments that the NETUNO-HC system shows efficiency in the data mining process, due to the implementation of the following techniques: (i) a SQL primitive to efficient execute the databases queries using hierarchies; (ii) the construction and encoding of numerical hierarchies; (iii) the use of Beam Search strategy, and (iv) the indexing and encoding of rules in a hash table in order to avoid mining discovered rules. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In the past few years, the multi-agent systems (MAS) area has presented an accelerated growth. New techniques and tools are constantly being proposed and several methodologies have been published to support the development of MAS. Most of these methodologies concentrate on the system analysis phase, giving almost no support for MAS implementation. Since agents can be seen as sort of specialized distributed components, in this paper we propose an agent deployment model based on the CORBA Component Model. We also describe a case study to show the potential of an agent-based application development using this model. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper presents a new, simple and efficient texture classification method using Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm. In the learning stage, LZW algorithm constructs dictionaries for the horizontal and vertical structure of each class. In the classification stage, texture samples to be classified are encoded by LZW in static mode, using the dictionaries constructed in the learning stage, in vertical and horizontal scanning order. A sample is assigned to the class whose dictionaries minimize the average horizontal and vertical coding rate. The classifier was evaluated for various sample sizes and training set sizes, using 30 Brodatz textures. The proposed method correctly classified 100% of 3000 Brodatz texture samples, and direct comparisons indicated the superiority of the method over several high performance classifiers. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - While neural networks have been successfully used in a number of machine learning applications, logical languages have been the standard for the representation of legal and argumentative reasoning. In this paper, we present a new hybrid model of computation that allows for the deduction and learning of argumentative reasoning. We propose a Neural Argumentation Algorithm to translate argumentation networks into standard neural networks, and prove correspondence between the semantics of the two networks. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - In text categorization tasks, the dimensionality reduction become necessary to computation and interpretability of the results generated by machine learning algorithms due to the high-dimensional vector representation of the documents. This paper describes a new feature extraction method called semantic mapping and its application in categorization of web documents. The semantic mapping uses SOM maps to construct variables in reduced space, where each variable describes the behavior of a group of features semantically related. The performance of the semantic mapping is measured and compared empirically with the performance of sparse random mapping and PCA methods and shows to be better than random mapping and a good alternative to PCA. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - Evolutionary Programming (EP) has been used to solve a large variety of problems. This technique uses concepts of Darwin's theory to evolve finite state machines (FSMs). However, most works develop tailor-made EP frameworks to solve specific problems. These frameworks generally require significant modifications in their kernel to be adapted to other domains. To easy reuse and to allow modularity, modular FSMs were introduced. They are fundamental to get more generic EP frameworks. In this paper, we introduce the framework Splinter, capable of evolving modular FSMs. It can be easily configured to solve different problems. We illustrate this by presenting results from the use of Splinter for two problems: the artificial ant problem and the sequence of characters. The results validate the Splinter implementation and show that the modularity benefits do not decrease the performance. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In this paper we describe the learning and reasoning mechanisms of a cognitive model based on the systemic approach and on the autopoiesis theory. These mechanisms assume perception and action capabilities that can be captured through propositional symbols and uses logic for representing environment knowledge. The logical theories are represented by their conjunctive and disjunctive normal forms. These representations are enriched to contain annotations that explicitly store the relationship among the literals and (dual) clauses in both forms. Based on this representation, algorithms are presented that leam a theory from the agent's experiences in the environment and that are able to determine the robustness degree of the theories given an assignment representing the environment state. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper presents a clustering method for interval-valued data using a dynamic cluster algorithm with adaptive squared Euclidean distances. This method furnishes a partition and a prototype to each cluster by optimizing an adequacy criterion that measures the fitting between the clusters and their representatives. To compare a class with its representative, the method uses an adaptive version of a squared Euclidean distance to interval-valued data. Experiments with real and artificial interval-valued data sets shows the usefulness of the this method. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - One of the main objectives of a Machine Learning - ML - system is to induce a classifier that minimizes classification errors. Two relevant topics in ML are the understanding of which domain characteristics and inducer limitations might cause an increase in misclassification. In this sense, this work analyzes two important issues that might influence the performance of ML systems: class imbalance and errorprone small disjuncts. Our main objective is to investigate how these two important aspects are related to each other. Aiming at overcoming both problems we analyzed the behavior of two over-sampling methods we have proposed, namely Smote + Tomek links and Smote + ENN. Our results suggest that these methods are effective for dealing with class imbalance and, in some cases, might help in ruling out some undesirable disjuncts. However, in some cases a simpler method, Random over-sampling, provides compatible results requiring less computational resources. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - A growing need related to the use of knowledge-based systems (KBSs) is that these systems provide ways of adaptive interaction with the user. A comparative analysis of approaches to develop KBSs allowed us to identify a high functional quality level and a lack of integration of human factors in their frameworks. In this article, we propose an approach to develop adaptive and interactive KBSs that integrate works from the Knowledge Engineering and HCI areas, through the definition of a unified software architecture. A contribution of this work is the use of interaction patterns in order to define the interaction flow according to the user profile. These interaction patterns are defined for different kinds of interaction, such as, explanation, cooperation, argumentation or criticism. The reusable architecture components were implemented using Java and Protégé-2000, and they were used in a KBS for assessment of installments of tax debts. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The mission of an organization stands for its goals and also leads corrections likely to occur in the posture adopted by the organization before the society. In order to fulfill the goals of the organization, this one needs to interact with other components of the society. Within an organization each individual responsible for the sale and purchase of either commodities or services detains knowledge concerning possible values of the criteria used to represent a determined commodity or service which may be either offered or accepted in a negotiation. So, an offer may be seen as an inconsistency aroused between the previous knowledge owned by the negotiator and the offer. This article presents a Paraconsistent Approach based on a heuristic of multi-value decrement followed by formalization into Evidential Paraconsistent Logic to assess offers in a negotiation session. When compared to the Utility Value Approach, the paraconsistent one converges toward the negotiation ending with fewer interactions. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper describes a new generic architecture for dialog systems enabling communication between a human user and a personal assistant based on speech acts. Dialog systems are often domain-related applications. That is, the system is developed for specific applications and cannot be reused in other domains. A major problem concerns the development of scalable dialog systems capable to be extended with new tasks without much effort. In this paper we discuss a generic dialog architecture for a personal assistant. The assistant uses explicit task representation and knowledge to achieve an "intelligent" dialog. The independence of the dialog architecture from knowledge and from tasks allows the agent to be extended without needing to modify the dialog structure. The system has been implemented in a collaborative environment in order to personalize services and to facilitate the interaction with collaborative applications like e-mail clients, document managers or design tools. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The scope of this paper is to analyze the main obstacles that resulted in the deployment of an unsuccessful G2G (Government to Government) enterprise in Brazil due to user resistance to Information Systems. In order to achieve this, case study explanatory methodology along with interpretative research based on a recent real-life case was adopted, namely the digital link between the Brazilian Central Bank and the Federal Senate. Some findings are drawn with respect to the importance of adequately managing the change associated with an endeavor such as the one analyzed in order to assist policy makers and public administrators in dealing with this new field of knowledge. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - We describe a refutation-based theorem proving algorithm capable of checking the satisfiability of non-ground formulae modulo (a combination of) theories. The key idea is the use of abstraction to drive the application of (i) ground satisfiability checking modulo theories axiomatized by equational clauses, (ii) Presburger arithmetic, and (iii) quantifier instantiation. A prototype implementation is used to discharge the proof obligations necessary to show the correctness of some typical programs manipulating arrays. On these benchmarks, the prototype automatically discharge more proof obligations than Simplify - the prover of reference for program checking - thereby confirming the viability of our approach. ©Sorineer-Verlae 2004.

AB  - For some B2C or B2B market places, such as electronic shopping malls, agents representing the buyers could "go shopping" and negotiate with several stores looking for the best deal. To develop agents capable to act in a scenario like this one, it is necessary to deal with several issues that go beyond the bilateral negotiation or auction. In the agent mediated e-commerce literature, there are no in-depth studies on this kind of negotiation, which we call sequential bilateral negotiations (SBNs). The related works provide only superficial insights on multiple bilateral negotiations or are rather concerned with auction models. In this paper, we characterize SBNs, showing the differences between them and auctions or simple bilateral negotiations. We also discuss the main issues on defining a negotiation protocol and designing agents for SBN. In order to achieve a better understanding on SBN and its practical implications, we present a particular implementation of a SBN protocol and an ensemble of agents capable of carrying negotiations under this protocol. This implementation provides experimental results illustrating some nuances of this kind of negotiation model. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - One of the major difficulties to finding accurate mobile terminal location is the lack of line-of-sight propagation (NLOS) caused by blocking of the signal's direct path by obstacles. A tracking approach based on the Kalman recursive filtering of time-of-arrival (TOA) measurement has been successfully employed to mitigate NLOS error, but it strongly depends on proper identification of NLOS/LOS states. In this paper we propose a composite hypothesis testing to detect LOS⇄NLOS transitions. The decision thresholds are set to minimize false alarm and miss probabilities considering statistical parameters of the location scenario. Restricted assumptions such as uncorrelation of TOA measurements (when NLOS corrupted) and knowledge of NLOS error statistics are not required. Simulation results show the validity of the proposal when compared with the technique of identifying NLOS/LOS states by standard deviation computation. © Springer-Verlag 2004.
