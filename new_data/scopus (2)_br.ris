AB  - After an overview of the cellular logic image processor, CLIP 3, parallel algorithms for joining two points are described. These real time algorithms are simple, work properly, preserve the connectivity, are based only on logic, and show much of the behavior of processing occurring in sensory elements of animals.

AB  - Parallel image processing shows certain general similarities to retinal processing and shares with optical computing the characteristics of parallelism. Simulation on digital serial computers (DSC‘s), although possible in the simpler cases, very soon becomes almost uncontrollable, requiring large memories and very long programming and execution times. Advances in present circuit technology now permit one to construct large arrays of interconnected parallel logic elements resulting in real-time parallel machines where the action of a statement is simultaneous on all the points of the array. A typical processor of this kind is briefly described and an introduction to its code is given. Examples of symmetrical and directional functions and parallel algorithms are also presented. Possible applications of such processors in image processing, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence are briefly discussed.

AB  - The general properties of human speech are discussed as a first step in studying the most important characteristics to be incorporated by a language expert system. It is proposed that man has different types of speech ranging between literary and specialized proses. The general rules for each of these limiting uses are outlined, treating language in the context of information theory and using fuzzy set theory as the basic tool. It is concluded that specialized speech is the most common use of human language; thus its rules have to be the guidelines for development of any language expert system. Some of the basic characteristics of such a system are presented and discussed. © 1985.

AB  - Ensuring the daily movement of millions of passengers and tons of goods in the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro is a complex task that involves several transportation modes; federal, state, and local agencies; public and private operators; and skilled personnel. Very often parts of the system become ineffective. Coordination among agencies and operators is almost nonexistent, but they work together when a critical situation arises. Another problem that has been addressed and that requires similar treatment is evacuation in the event of a nuclear disaster at the nuclear power plant in the state of Rio de Janeiro. For these numerous ill-structured problems, in which human behavior, social and political considerations, and multiobjective decision making are involved, the potential of expert systems technology was considered and is included in the contingency transportation planning.

AB  - Possible errors in earlier methods of coding structures are discussed, particularly with regard to α- and β-conformation and double bonds. The proposed method of coding is based on the absolute interatomic distances and the relative orientations of atoms. The coding system agrees with previous theoretical equations, except for density matrices; the usual classification of α, β and δ effects is obviously not included. An advantage of the method is that neighbouring atoms which have negligible effect are not included in the coding, so that the number of plausible structures is reduced. Another advantage is that similar structures can be tested, atom by atom, to a level at which complete structural equivalence no longer exists. The program developed on this basis is applicable with personal computers and provides options which enable the theoretical spectrum to be predicted, the signals to be interpreted if the experimental spectrum is known, and the influence of each neighbouring atom on the carbon signal to be studied. © 1989.

AB  - Service restoration, system reconfiguration, and other related problems are formulated and solved by heuristic search, which is a search strategy (e.g. depth-first search) armed with practical rules (say, based on operator experience) to guide the search. The proposed framework allows designing algorithms to solve a wide range of distribution restoration problems. System operator procedures can be accommodated as part of the search process. Test results are presented. An illustrative example is given in the Appendix. © 1989 IEEE

AB  - Neural networks, or connectionist systems, have recently emerged as a powerful model of collective, parallel computation of great interest in artificial intelligence and combinatorial optimization. The understanding of neural networks is still largely dependent upon simulations, which in turn can be of great interest to the designer of parallel software, owing to the inherently distributed character of those systems. This paper is concerned with the simulation of one specific class of neural networks, namely those introduced by J. J. Hopfield. We discuss the design and occam implementation of a distributed parallel simulator of such networks, allowing for both binary‐ and continuous‐response neurons. A design is provided which we judge to be generic to a large extent, and then problems related to an occam implementation are discussed. One problem of particular relevance is the potential occurrence of communication deadlocks as a result of the unbuffered communication among occam processes. Copyright © 1990 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - In this article, the problem of decision making in a prototypical complex decision environment is cast into the conceptual framework of large-scale systemstheory. The problem of the lead decision maker within a decision team is described and an operational model is given. It is pointed out that this primarily real intelligence-only decision team is both knowlegable and adaptive, but not as reliable as might be required under conditions of high cognitive loading. An artificial intelligence-based decision components, the "trusted assistant",is the proposed as a means of achieving a more effective intelligence balance within the system. The primarily structural features of this personal expert system are presented and considerations involved in incorporating it into present-day large-scale decision systems are discussed. It is shown that in many instances this trusted assistant can play a distinctly novel and vital role in the decision making process. © 1991.

AB  - This article clarifies some concepts of artificial intelligence (AI), discusses some of its applications, and demonstrates its potential application in the petroleum industry. AI is divided into two levels: the psychological, where it attempts to represent knowledge explicity, and the intuitive, where explication of knowledge is not important and the emphasis is on brain architecture. Expert systems, which implement explicit knowledge, are discussed in more detail. A brief discussion of use of AI in Brazil, particularly at Petrobras, is presented.

AB  - This work describes the utilization of two groups of programs in searching for characteristic signals of NMR 13C of steroidal compounds. The first group of programs used data bases with the spectral data and a methodology that enables the choice and the search of substructures. The chemical shifts and multiplicities for each specific substructure are used as rules to identify different types and subtypes of steroidal compounds. The second one was built to apply the rules formulated by the first group of programs and to foresee any skeletal based on a spectral analysis.

AB  - A modularization discipline for database schemas is first described. The dicipline incorporates both a strategy for enforcing integrity constraints and a tactic for organizing large sets of database structures, integrity constraints, and operations. A software tool that helps the development and maintenance of database schemas modularized according to the discipline is then presented. It offers a user-friendly interface that guides the designer through the various stages of the creation of a new module or through the process of changing objects of existing modules. The tool incorporates, in a declarative style, a description of the design and redesign rules behind the modularization discipline, hence facilitating the incremental addition of new expertise about database design. © 1991, ACM.

AB  - The present paper introduce a new model of fuzzy neuron, one which increases the computational power of the aruncial neuron, turning it also into a symbolic processing device. This model proposes the synapsis to be symbolically and numerically defined, by means of the assignment of tokens to the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The matching or concatenation compatibility between these tokens is used to decided about the possible connections among neurons of a given net. The strength of the compatible synapsis is made dependent on the amount of the available presynaptic and post synaptic tokens. The symbolic and numeric processing capacity of the new fuzzy neuron is used here to build a neural net (JARGON) to disclose the existing knowledge in natural language data bases such as medical files, set of interviews, and reports about engineering operations. © 1992 IEEE

AB  - The problem of generating guillotine cutting patterns for a rectangular plate is studied and a type of structure is proposed for representing the solution of the problem, called and-or graph, which is commonly used in the Artificial Intelligence environment. To search the graph we combined two classical strategies: depth-first and hill-climbing. Further, some heuristics are considered and computational results are presented, relating their performance on examples from both literature as well as randomly generated. © 1992.

AB  - An emergent alternative to the conventional artificial intelligence approach, the artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to the identification of Mössbauer spectral patterns. The advantages of this approach are the robustness and the generalization capability. In this paper we utilize the counterpropagation architecture of ANN with an unsupervised training algorithm. This kind of training only needs a data set with samples of the patterns to be recognized and the ANN itself extracts statistical information to organize the similar patterns into convenient classes. To increase the training performance, the Mössbauer spectra are first preprocessed and then applied to the ANN. The results obtained with a 0.3% fluctuation training data set of five different patterns and a 1.0% fluctuation test set of the same patterns reveal a very good recognition rate for a few training sessions. The ANN synapses after training can be interpreted as a Mössbauer spectrum that is the average of the training spectra of the same class. As the number of training sessions increases, this internal representation exhibits a fluctuation that tends to zero. The results encourage us to incorporate an ANN that performs the spectral pattern recognition task into Mössbauer data acquisition equipment. © 1993.

AB  - Neural network computing is one of the fastest growing fields of artificial intelligence due to its ability to “learn” nonlinear relationships. This article presents the approach of back propagation neural networks for modeling of free radical polymerization in high pressure tubular reactors. Industrial data were used to train the network for prediction of the temperature profile along the reactor, as well as polymer properties such as density, melt flow index, and molecular weight averages. Comparisons were made between the neural network and mechanistic model predictions published in the literature. Results showed the promising capability of a neural network as an alternative approach to model polymeric systems. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Copyright © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - The paper proposes a new model of Petri nets based on the use of logic based neurons. In contrast to the existing generalizations, this approach is aimed at neural-type modeling of the entire concept with a full exploitation of the learning capabilities of the processing units being used there. The places and transitions of the net are represented by OR and AND-type and DOMINANCE neurons, respectively. A correspondence between this model and the previous two-valued counterpart is also revealed. The learning aspects associated with the nets are investigated. © 1994 IEEE

AB  - One of the products of engineering, besides constructed artifacts, is design documentation. To understand how design participants use documentation, designers and typical documentation users were interviewed and protocols were taken of them both creating and using design documentation. The protocols were taken from realistic projects of preliminary design for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVAC). The studies of document creation and use revealed three important issues: (1) design participants not only look up design facts; they frequently access documents to obtain information about the rationale for design decisions; (2) the design rationale that they see often is missing from the documents; and (3) design requirements change frequently over a project life cycle so that design documents are often inconsistent and out of date. Recognizing these documentation issues in design practice, a new approach was developed in which documents are no longer static records, but rather interactive design models supporting a case. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated by constructing a running system and testing it with designers on realistic problems. The costs and benefits of creating and using documentation of design rationale also were analyzed. In particular, the active documents approach was evaluated for a routine, preliminary design in domains where community practice is widely shared and largely standardized. The approach depends on the feasibility of creating a parametric design model for the design domain. © 1994, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - We study the storage properties associated with generalized Hebbian learning rules which present four free parameters that allow for asymmetry. We also introduce two extra parameters in the post-synaptic potentials in order to further improve the critical capacity. Using signal-to-noise analysis, as well as computer simulations on an analog network, we discuss the performance of the rules for arbitrarily biased patterns and find that the critical storage capacity alpha c becomes maximal for a particular symmetric rule (alpha c diverges in the sparse coding limit). Departures from symmetry decrease alpha c but can increase the robustness of the model.

AB  - This paper describes HYCONES II--a tool to enable the construction of hybrid connectionist expert systems to solve classification problems. HYCONES II offers to the knowledge engineer a hybrid knowledge base that integrates frames with three different neural network models: the combinatorial neural model--CNM, the Fuzzy ARTMAP and the Semantic ART--SMART models. The latter is a new model, introduced by this paper, based on a combination of the two previous models. The validation section compares the performance of these three neural models to solve diagnostic problems in two medical domains. This paper also presents HYCONES II knowledge representation features, built in the symbolic component of its hybrid knowledge-base, to deal and represent fuzzy medical variables. Finally, the present status and future developments of the project are presented.

AB  - The problem of verifying the integrity of fuzzy knowledge bases is discussed. An approach to find potential inconsistencies in fuzzy rule based systems is described. The approach models the knowledge base as a High Level Fuzzy Petri Net and uses the structural properties of the net for verification. Basic notions on approximate reasoning, regular and hierarchical High Level Fuzzy Petri Nets are also given. The method used for consistency checking is reviewed through the analysis of several cases including simple and chaining rules. Procedures for discovering potential inconsistencies at both local and global levels are described. © 1994.

AB  - A competence theory of diagnosis that extends past efforts in this effort and provides further conceptual insight into the diagnostic reasoning process. A competence theory of diagnosis makes two major contributions. First, it provides a decomposition of diagnosis and defines the diagnostic goals for its constituents. Secondly, it describes how such goals can be achieved under specific conditions. Tasks and methods are organized in a task method decomposition structure.

AB  - The acquisition of connectivity patterns in an artificial, three-layer neural circuit for control of human gait was simulated through a backpropagation algorithm. Input signals for the neural network were equivalent to hip, knee, and ankle angles, and to vertical ground reaction forces during walking. Neural network outputs consisted of signals proportional to the activity of five lower limb muscles. Many network input configurations and connectivity restrictions were tested. Data from normal gait were used for network training. Preliminary testing of network responses in unknown environments was effected by presenting the neural networks with actual pathologic data at the input layer and by later investigating network outputs. Results favored restricted connectivity between middle and output layer neurons. Further, explicit recall of recent events was found to improve network behavior.

AB  - This paper looks at the intersections between feminist epistemology, feminist jurisprudence and research on artificial intelligence and the law. It is suggested that. feminist theory highlights the role of subjectivity which is ignored in the traditional epistemology of AI systems. This allows AI systems to appear to be “perspectiveless” when they may be tacitly used in a normative role which ignores alternative knowledges. The paper looks at the Cyc system as an example. In developing an expert system to advise on Sex Discrimination law a number of lessons are learned both from the Forms Helper system and more particularly from feminist jurisprudence and from the critique of AI from feminist epistemology. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - After brief considerations about intelligence, a comparative study between biologic and artificial intelligence is made. The specialists in Artificial Intelligence found that intelligence is purely a matter of physical symbol manipulation. The enterprise of Artificial Intelligence aims to understand what we might call Brain Intelligence in terms of concepts and techniques of engineering. However the philosophers believed that computer-machine can have syntax, but can never have semantics. In other words, that they can follow rules, such as those of arithmetic or grammar, but not understand what to us are meanings of symbols, such as words. In the present paper it is stressed that brain/mind complex constitutes a monolithic systemic that functions with emergent properties at several levels of hierarchical organization. These hierarchical levels are non-reducible to one another. They are at least three (neuronal, functional, and semantic), and they function within an interactional plan. The brain/mind complex, which transform informations in meanings, deals with problems by means of both logical and non-logical mechanisms; while logic allows the mind to arrange the elements for reasoning, the non-logical mechanisms (fuzzy logic, heuristics, insights) allows the mind to develop strategies to find solutions. The model for construction of the "intelligent machine" is the operating way of the brain/mind complex, which does not always use logical processes. The role of information science in Artificial Intelligence is to search for knowledge itself (virtual knowledge), rather than to simply attempt a logico-mathematical formalization of knowledge.

AB  - The paper introduces and studies an idea of distributed modeling treating it as a new paradigm of fuzzy system modeling and analysis. This form of modeling is oriented towards developing individual (local) fuzzy models for specific modeling landmarks (expressed as fuzzy sets) and determining the essential logical relationships between these local models. The models themselves are implemented in the form of logic processors being regarded as specialized fuzzy neural networks. The interaction between the processors is developed either in an inhibitory or excitatory way. In more descriptive way, the distributed model can be sought as a collection of fuzzy finite state machines with their individual local first or higher order memories. It is also clarified how the concept of distributed modeling narrows down a gap between purely numerical (quantitative) models and the qualitative ones originated within the realm of Artificial Intelligence. The overall architecture of distributed modeling is discussed along with the detailed learning schemes. The results of extensive simulation experiments are provided as well. © 1995 IEEE

AB  - In recent years, interest in the application of artificial intelligence technologies to power system operation, planning and design has grown rapidly. The application of non-symbolic techniques, particularly Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), is a new area of research in this field. In this paper, intelligent systems for solving power system state estimation problems are investigated. A new framework for the solution of the topology determination, observability analysis and bad data processing tasks is proposed. Pattern analysis techniques have been developed to deal with noisy environments. An ANN for topology determination and a supervised learning algorithm for very large training sets, the Optimal Estimate Training 2 (OET2), are introduced. OET2 overcomes the major shortcomings of the back-propagation learning rule and can also be very useful for other problems. Power system network decomposition techniques are used to decrease the computational burden of the topology classfier training session. Tests using the IEEE 24- and 118-bus systems illustrate situations in which the existent tools for data processing fail. © 1995.

AB  - The constrained two-dimensional cutting problem is concerned with the way a set of pieces should be cut from a plate, taking into account that the cuts are of the guillotine type and that the number of times a piece can be cut is limited. Both plate and pieces are rectangular shaped. Yr 1983, Wang proposed an algorithm for incremental development of rectangles. Later, Oliveira and Ferreira not only proposed but numerically tested an improvement to the algorithm as. A generalization of these methods is proposed. It will be stated that such methods are particular cases of uninformed search methods, widely studied in the area of Artificial Intelligence. Knowing that more efficient methods exist, namely 'informed methods', diffren alternatives to orientate the search process, while reducing the required computer memory and time, are defined. Using an adequate selection of an heuristic function it is possible to guarantee the determination of a best solution. Such ideas are numerically tested in this work. The results indicate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. © 1995.

AB  - In this study some considerations are presented regarding the utilization of the tools of Artificial Intelligence based on knowledge, in order to assist engineers in scheduling manufacturing processes. To this end, a revision of concepts and characteristics of expert systems is also presented here. There are many aspects to be considered on choosing a tool of Artificial Intelligence for use in a given area of the business. For scheduling, specifically, the situation is not at all different. In this case, one must take into consideration the fact that the scheduling sector is not isolated within the company, whether it renders service or is an industry. Manufacturing acts as a whole unit and when considering it as part of this context, the other sectors should also be known, not in details, but it should be clear where and when scheduling interacts with one of the other areas. And then through an analysis of these interactions and based on the results, it is possible to choose the software tools suitable to the problem. In addition to the aspect of choosing the appropriate tool of Artificial Intelligence, the study presents a discussion on some softwares of Artificial Intelligence, specific to manufacturing scheduling, known in the literature and utilized in big companies in recent years.

AB  - The problem of scheduling projects is dealt with in this study with the aim of comparing tools in order to find the optimum or near-optimum solution. There is an infinite number of tools that serve this purpose, both the traditional ones based on more sophisticated mathematical formulations, and the more modern and experimental ones that utilize techniques of artificial intelligence. The conventional methods with a mathematical basis, exemplified by the technique of Branch and Bound, and those using specific computational packages to find solutions, such as GAMS, are highly efficient in solving problems of project scheduling that consider the temporal organization of a set of tasks so as to fulfil given objectives. In this type of problem, restrictions involving resources and various other restrictions are considered in order to schedule the project. In recent years many different ways of solving problems were employed in order to find the best solution for this kind of scheduling, which nearly always turns out to involve an extremely complex problem of overall scheduling when real situations are considered. At present much more modern methods have arisen to solve problem, within the technique of Artificial Intelligence, bringing advantages and disadvantages. This technique was devised to help choose the most suitable tool for the problem at hand.

AB  - This article presents a resume of extensive research carried out in the area of construction of pre-molded parts. The problem was studied under several different aspects, such as construction, computation, planning, and good results were obtained. Construction with pre-molded elements means a promising future for Brazil. At present, little of this kind of construction has been done in the country, considering the total number of constructions. Nevertheless, it is a practical construction, used all over the world, and offers a number of advantages over conventional construction. In the social area it is quite important, for this kind of construction was utilized to reconstruct European cities after the wars of this century. At that time, great projects were carried out by architects of renown, such as Cropius and Le Corbusier, who left a mark in the history of civil construction.

AB  - The first and the important phase of distributed problem solving is problem decomposition. However, most of the approaches in Distributed AI or Multi-agent systems proceed with the assumption that the problem is already decomposed and concentrate on the other issues. In this paper we present a step towards a methodology for decomposing a given problem either spatially, temporally or by abstraction. Features of these different types are compared and technique for implementing the process is given. Still a lot remains to be done before we can arrive at an application independent formalism to decompose a problem. However, the paper attempts to describe tasks and their interdependencies through the formalism. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The increase of computing power of the microcomputers has stimulated the building of direct manipulation interfaces that allow graphical representation of Linear Programming (LP) models. This work discusses the components of such a graphical interface as the basis for a system to assist users in the process of formulating LP problems. In essence, this work proposes a methodology which considers the modelling task as divided into three stages which are specification of the Data Model, the Conceptual Model and the LP Model. The necessity for using Artificial Intelligence techniques in the problem conceptualisation and to help the model formulation task is illustrated.

AB  - Image registration is one of the basic image processing operations in remote sensing. With the increase in the number of in, ages collected every day from different sensors, automated registration of multisensor/multispectral images has become a very important issue. A wide range of registration techniques has been developed for many different types of applications and data. Given the diversity of the data, it is unlikely that a single registration scheme will work satisfactorily for all different applications. A possible solution is to integrate multiple registration algorithms into a rule-based artificial intelligence system so that appropriate methods for any given set of multisensor data can be automatically selected. The first step in the development of such an expert system for remote sensing application would be to obtain a better understanding and characterization of the various existing techniques for image registration. This is the main objective of this paper as we present a comparative study of some recent image registration methods. We emphasize in particular techniques for multisensor image data, and a brief discussion of each of the techniques is given. This comprehensive study will enable the user to select algorithms that work best for his/her particular application domain.

AB  - Neural networks are a relatively new computer artificial intelligence method which attempt to mimic the brain's problem solving process and can be used for predicting nonlinear economic time series. Neural networks are used to look for patterns in data, learn these patterns, and then classify new patterns and make forecasts. Feedforward neural networks pass the data forward from input to output, while recurrent networks have a feedback loop where data can be fed back into the input at some point before it is fed forward again for further processing and final output. Some have argued that since time series data may have autocorrelation or time dependence, the recurrent neural network models which take advantage of time dependence may be useful. Feedforward and recurrent neural networks are used for comparison in forecasting the Japanese yen/US dollar exchange rate. A traditional ARIMA model is used as a benchmark for comparison with the neural network models. Results for out of sample show that the feedforward model is relatively accurate in forecasting both price levels and price direction, despite being quite simple and easy to use. However, the recurrent network forecast performance was lower than that of the feedforward model. This may be because feed forward models must pass the data from back to forward as well as forward to back, and can sometimes become confused or unstable. Both the feedforward and recurrent models performed better than the ARIMA benchmark model. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Artificial neural networks can represent and handle information by means of interconnected processing elements, in a manner similar to that of biologic neurons. Artificial neural networks are useful in processing time-patterned biologic signals, such as electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms, particularly in tasks involving pattern classification and recognition. They do not need to be programmed, since they are capable of learning. Using artificial neural networks to build associative memories and perform true parallel processing permits "intelligent" biomedical instrumentation.

AB  - Hycones II is a tool that facilitates the construction of hybrid connectionist expert systems to solve problems in classification. Hycones II provides a hybrid system that integrates frames with three types of neural network: the "combinatorial" neural model (CNM), the "Fuzzy ARTMAP" model, and the "Semantic ART" (SMART) model, a combination of the CNM and Fuzzy ARTMAP. We will compare the ability of these three models to solve diagnostic problems in two medical domains.

AB  - A real time knowledge processing procedure is proposed for rule-based systems in general and control systems applications in particular. Distinguishing features of the procedure include a mechanism for rule base compression and an inference scheme based on matrix operators. The procedure is also amenable for schedulability analysis to provide response time warranty An application concerning supervisory group control of elevators is also included to show the usefulness of the proposed procedure. ©1996 IEEE.

AB  - Energy is continuously dissipated in electric power systems due to electrical resistance in transmission and distribution lines. This paper addresses the problem of obtaining a network topology with minimum energy losses for electric power distribution systems. As distribution networks must operate radially, the problem can be formulated as a generalization of the minimum spanning tree problem. The generalization is due to variation in costs as network configuration changes. Nonlinear network flow techniques are teamed with search strategies borrowed from the field of artificial intelligence to overcome computation intractability. © 1997 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The accurate diagnosis of accidents in a nuclear power plant has fundamental importance for decision making necessary to mitigate their consequences for the power plant as well as for the general public, on the basis of emergency planning. Two main characteristics should be achieved in this kind of diagnostics, namely, real-time features and adaptive capacity. The first characteristic gives the operators the possibility of predicting degraded operations and monitoring critical safety functions related to that specific situation. The second one allows the system to be able to deal with accidents that were not incorporated in the training sample set, in which case the operators are unprepared because they were not trained to face an event that they did not observe even in simulator training. The Three Mile Island accident is a classic one to demonstrate that these kinds of events are possible. Several methodologies have been tried to match those characteristics. While the first one is achieved through the permanent evolution of new faster processors, the second one can only be achieved through the simulation of human cognitive processes, which show higher adaptive behavior. Our model utilizes a neural network, fuzzy sets, and a genetic algorithm to simulate that behavior. We have used a neural network activated by an additive model and trained with an unsupervised competitive training law. Once trained with three accidents (steam generator tube rupture, blackout, and loss-of-coolant accident), a synoptic matrix was obtained, in which the elements represent the interchanging weights between neurons in the concatenated input/output space and the competitive neurons that fight to encode the input-output vector. This kind of competition establishes a statistical classification of the state variables, changing with time, clustering them in centroids labeling the kind of accident for which variables are being sampled. Thus, the accident identification is done in real time with the synaptic matrix. However, the centroids are located in the same time value, in view of the fact that the neural network algorithm treats the variable time as an independent one. Therefore, a genetic algorithm is applied to a fuzzy system formed by the partition of the variables space with fuzzy sets determined by the neural network centroids, in order to estimate the optimal positions in the time variable where the fuzzy system centroids must be located. As a consequence, the diagnostic can be done in representative regions of each accident with maximum confidence.

AB  - A comprehensive survey of computer-based systems that apply artificial intelligence methods to detect and identify component faults in nuclear power plants is presented. Classification criteria are established that categorize artificial intelligence diagnostic systems according to the types of computing approaches used (e.g., computing tools, computer languages, and shell and simulation programs), the types of methodologies employed (e.g., types of knowledge, reasoning and inference mechanisms, and diagnostic approach), and the scope of the system. The major issues of process diagnostics and computer-based diagnostic systems are identified and cross-correlated with the various categories used for classification. Ninety-five publications are reviewed.

AB  - The present paper proposes a hybrid approach based on reactive agent technology as a post-object paradigm for building intelligent CAD systems. It represents an evolution of previous positions and articles by the authors motivated by a clear need to provide forms of active support for the design process rather than seeking full design automation purposes. Key concepts about agency and reactivity, as well as their usefulness in design systems, are presented. Also a basic tool called XLOG+, for developing agent-based systems, comprising logic and object oriented approaches, is discussed. Finally, the proposed hybrid agents are embedded in a new integrated CAD system architecture and an implemented prototype example in the area of solid modelling is briefly presented. © 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

AB  - This paper introduces Chart D2, a Congenital Heart Disease Diagnostician that employs a case-based model where specific and general knowledge are combined in reasoning. Specific knowledge is represented in the form of cases while general knowledge is represented in the form of category descriptors. When solving a new case, Chart D2 uses its general knowledge to draw hypotheses and to guide the search for the most similar cases it has already "seen". The retrieved cases, representing specific knowledge, are then used to support one of the hypotheses and to justify the conclusion reached. Chart D2 has been based on an earlier hybrid connectionist/symbolic program called Hycones, developed in the same application domain. Besides enhancing some of Hycones' capabilities, the new system proposes solutions for common problems in Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), such as case matching, indexing and learning. The system Chart D2 is presented and evaluated, using real cases collected from a medical database. The performance of the system is contrasted with that of Hycones and two other learning algorithms. Moreover, similar research efforts on the use of other sources of knowledge by CBR systems are discussed, and topics for further research are suggested.

AB  - A procedure for the identification of substituent groups (viz. angelate, tiglate, etc.) attached to any of the atoms in the conventional skeleton of a natural product is described. It consists in the use of the program MACRONO, which was developed for finding subspectra due to the carbons in the said substituent groups amid the raw 13C NMR spectroscopic data from any given natural product (by means of comparisons of all possible subsets of the observed chemical shifts with those contained in an apposite database, built with literature 13C NMR spectroscopic data regarding those groups). This procedure enables one to expunge the chemical shifts not due to skeletal carbons from the initial dataset, which then can be input to the expert system SISTEMAT, for skeletal identification. © 1997 - IOS Press.

AB  - This essay describes another improvement to the expert system named SISTEMAT. The purpose of such improvement is to help chemists who work with natural products to figure out chemical structures. SISTEMAT uses Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) 13C data to ensemble compatible substructures according to related spectra. The system also is able to suggest a list of probable carbon skeletons. Those will work as models to structure generating programs, reducing the combinatorial explosion problem. This is the first essay from our research group which shows our system applications to aromatic compounds. A database with 700 NMR 13C spectra of flavonoids obtained from the literature was used. We applied heuristic SISTEMAT in order to discover ranges of chemical shifts that characterise several skeleton types. The diversity of flavonoid structures is due to several oxidation patterns at rings A and B. This phenomenon causes a great complexity in the absorptions at the aromatic region. Heuristic SISTEMAT was able to discover more accurate rules that differentiate specific patterns of oxidation for some skeleton types. The performance of the software was checked against a higher complex structure of a dimeric flavonoid recently isolated. The system gives only two possibilities of skeleton types (among 70 others). Both substructures found by the program showed correct linkages between carbons 2 and 7″ and 4 and 8″ of the monomers. © 1997 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, parsimonious covering theory is extended in such a way that temporal knowledge can be accommodated. In addition to causally associating possible manifestations with disorders, temporal relationships about duration and the time elapsed before a manifestation comes into existence can be represented by a graph. Precise definitions of the solution of a temporal diagnostic problem, as well as algorithms to compute the solutions are provided. The medical suitability of the extended parsimonious cover theory is studied in the domain of food-borne disease.

AB  - This paper presents a knowledge-based decision support system to assist mechanical ventilation in patients with the Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (DSSARDS). The knowledge base uses clinical algorithms developed from interviews and seminars with experts. The system contains 140 rules, applies backward chaining and was built on an IBM-PC compatible microcomputer. Clinical and physiological data and ventilator settings were used for suggestions of ventilatory support mode: (VSMODE) and settings (MVSET) and for hemodynamic evaluation and therapy (HEMO). Success rates (s) and kappa coefficient (k) were used to measure agreement between DSSARDS and physicians at 4 decision steps related to: beginning of mechanical ventilation (FIRSTSET), VSMODE, MVSET and HEMO. DSSARDS prototype was evaluated in a development phase with 6 patients aged 48.6 ± 15.9 years. Agreement results for 142 decision steps were: FIRSTSET k = 0.90, s = 0.93; VSMODE k = 0.76, s = 0.92; HEMO k = 0.58, s = 0.70, MVSET k = 0.86, s = 0.92 (p < 0.05 for all k). Improvements in the knowledge base were performed mainly in HEMO and VSMODE modules. The subsequent test phase studied 5 patients aged 54.8 ± 11.0 years in a total of 900 decision steps. Results were: FIRSTSET k = 0.93, s = 0.95; VSMODE k = 0.93, s = 0.96; HEMO k = 0.97, s = 0.99, MVSET k = 0.96, s = 0.97 (p < 0.05 for all k). The results indicate significant agreement between DSSARDS and physicians for all decision steps. This suggests that DSSARDS may be used as a support for decision making and a training tool for mechanical ventilation in patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome.

AB  - The combination of the techniques of expert systems and neural networks has the potential of producing more powerful systems; for example, expert systems able to learn from experience. In this paper, we address the combinatorial neural model (CNM), a kind of fuzzy neural network able to accommodate in a simple framework the highly desirable property of incremental learning, as well as the usual capabilities of expert systems. We show how an interval-based representation for membership grades makes CNM capable of reasoning with several types of uncertainty: vagueness, ignorance, and relevance commonly found in practical applications. In addition, we show how basic functions of expert systems such as inference, inquiry, censorship of input information, and explanation may be implemented. We also report experimental results of the application of CNM to the problem of deforestation monitoring of the Amazon region using satellite images. © 1997 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial intelligence techniques, such as fuzzy logic, neural network, and genetic algorithm, are recently showing a lot of promise in the application of power electronic systems. The paper describes the control strategy development, design, and experimental performance evaluation of a fuzzy-logic-based variable-speed wind generation system that uses a cagetype induction generator and double-sided pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) converters. The system can feed a utility grid maintaining unity power factor at all conditions or can supply an autonomous load. The fuzzy-logic-based control of the system helps to optimize efficiency and enhance performance. A complete 3.5-kW generation system has been developed, designed, and thoroughly evaluated by laboratory tests, in order to validate the predicted performance improvements. The system gives excellent performance and can easily be translated to a larger size in the field. © 1997 IEEE.

AB  - Petróleo Brasileiro S. A. (PETROBRÁS) in conjunction with Synergetics Science and Technology Inc. has developed a comprehensive graduate level educational program in intelligent system design technology. The primary goals of this program are: training professionals to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Neural Networks (NN) techniques to managerial and technological problem solving, and to do this in a manner that is both time-and cost-effective. This particular program has been centered around two distinct areas of specialization: symbolic AI and the connectionist approach (NN's). The AI section of the course is titled CAVIAR. The NN section of the course is titled CERN. Short courses and seminars were also part of the program. For this paper, our focus has been to deal with the special needs of graduate-level education in large companies as part of employee professional training. We will also explore the nuances of, and the various needs associated with teaching intelligent system design technologies to such a diverse group, as is found in large companies like PETROBRÁS. This paper also describes the needs that led to the development of such a broad-based program, the goals and structures of the various courses, the student profiles, educational facilities (libraries and computer laboratories), and the lessons learned. Finally, the conclusion offers recommendations.

AB  - The BF-graphs form a particular class of Directed Hypergraphs. For this important family, different applications are known in data bases and artificial intelligence domain. They may also be used to describe the behaviour of concurrent systems. We present here a theoretical analysis of several hyperpath problems in BF-graphs, with emphasis on the acyclic BF-graphs. After briefly exposing the basic concepts of directed hypergraphs, we present an algorithm for finding a BF-path. We next discuss the problem of finding a hyperpath cover, and present a polynomial solution for two constrained hyperpath problems. © Elsevier, Paris.

AB  - This paper is an evolution of a previous article by the authors1 (Bento, J. P., Feijó, B., Lloyd-Smith, D., Computers and Structures, 1977, 63(5), 1015-1032) motivated by the need to provide computational support to an agent-based implementation of design processes. It presents a new programming environment to support the development of CAD systems based on a hybrid agent architecture in which the symbolic reasoning is carried out by first-order logic. The reactive behaviour of the agents can be achieved through a number of characteristics proposed for the object-oriented environment. This environment is also a general proposal for representing engineering design knowledge in which logic is integrated into an object-oriented paradigm. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Limited.

AB  - Imperfect information is a very general term that comprises different types of information, such as uncertain, vague, fuzzy, inconsistent, possibilistic, probabilistic, partially or totally incomplete information [2]. In the literature of knowledge representation we find a different formal model for each one of these distinct types. For example, annotated logic is a formal model to represent inconsistent information. Annotated logics are non-classical logics introduced in [20] as a logic programming theory. They were proved to be paraconsistent. Based on [5], we present in this work the annotated logic programming theory and some of its applications in Artificial Intelligence (AI). We present it as a formalism to reason with inconsistent information and investigate its possibility to represent other types of imperfect information, such as possibilistic and non-monotonic reasoning. Our main goal is to verify and confirm the importance of annotated logics as a tool for developing knowledge-based and automated reasoning systems in AI.

AB  - This paper describes IDSSFLEX, a computer system for the analysis and evaluation of Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) design configurations. IDSSFLEX is an intelligent decision support system which selects from among several configurations and control strategy alternatives of design, the most appropriate one for a specific case. In order to accomplish such an objective, the system presents simultaneously the following features: ability to quantify subjective factors, ability to account for individual preferences, and ability to cope with multiple criteria decision making. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of the computer system. © 1998 Operational Research Society Ltd. All Rights reserved.

AB  - A widespread search strategy employed by predators in both vertebrate and invertebrate phyla is the well-known area-restricted search strategy. The generality, simplicity, and effectiveness of this strategy have made it emerge many times during the course of natural selection. In this work, an artificial intelligence state-space search procedure is developed using search guidelines gleaned from the foraging behavior of predators. This procedure, which we call predatory search, has been implemented on a NP-Hard combinatorial problem: the traveling salesman problem. Numerical results are presented for a limited set of benchmark problems, and area-restricted search seems to be effective: We have been able to find the optimal solution to, among others, a 400-city Manhattan problem.

AB  - Neural computation represents one of the fastest growing areas in artificial intelligence. Considering that the major limit of the thermalhydraulic design of PWR type nuclear reactors consists in the occurrence of critical heat flux (CHF), in the present work, it is developed an artificial neural net for the prediction of occurrence of CHF, utilizing experimental data obtained in rod bundle water flows for the net training. Application is performed for the range of the operational parameters of reactor INAP-11, being developed by CTM/SP. It was observed that the standard deviation of the final results, given by the net for the ratio between experimental and theoretical results for the CHF, is lower than those given by the EPRI and EPRI_MOD correlations, coupled to the COBRA-IV code, and that the average presents a very small deviation from the expected unity value.

AB  - The column generation approach to large-scale linear programming is extended to the mixed-integer case. Two general algorithms, a dual and a primal one, are presented. Both involve finding k-best solutions to combinatorial optimization subproblems. Algorithms for these subproblems must be tailored to each specific application. Their use is illustrated by applying them to a new combinatorial optimization problem with applications in Artificial Intelligence: Probabilistic Maximum Satisfiability. This problem is defined as follows: consider a set of logical sentences together with probabilities that they are true, assume this set of sentences is not satisfiable in the probabilistic sense, i.e., there is no probability distribution on the set of possible worlds (truth assignments to the sentences corresponding to at least one truth assignment to the logical variables they contain) such that for each sentence the sum of probabilities of the possible worlds in which it is true is equal to its probability of being true; determine a minimum set of sentences to be deleted in order to make the remaining set of sentences satisfiable. Computational experience with both algorithms is reported on. © 1998 Published byElsevier Science B.V.

AB  - To enhance power systems stability, extensive research has been conducted in the area of synchronous machines control, and several techniques and algorithms have been developed and implemented in real applications. One of the latest and most sophisticated techniques is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) based control. Increased interest has been focused in the use of these algorithms in control systems; different approaches have been proposed for their application. The results presented on several research papers show the advantages of such algorithms over the conventional control algorithms. In this paper, the problem of synchronous machines control is considered, and an overview of several artificial intelligence approaches as applied to the control of synchronous generators is presented. A critical and evaluating discussion on each Al approach is also included.

AB  - In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in the development of a class of artificial intelligent systems. This growing new class of technology has been applied successfully to a wide variety of applications. It is now becoming increasingly evident that in many cases best results can be obtained through the use of combination of such intelligent systems. In this paper, a class of hybrid intelligent systems has been applied in diagnosing a variety of faults in a range of electric power system equipments. The nature of the faults are diverse and no single intelligent algorithm is able to classify the faults. However, it is shown, in this paper, that a combinatorial intelligent system based on neuro-fuzzy, neuro-expert and fuzzy-expert algorithms can be successfully applied in the detection of a number of faults in a range of equipments. Test results using measurements on in-service power transformers in the Australian state of New South Wales and on a distribution feeder belonging to CEMIG, Brazil have been used to show the effectiveness of the proposed class of hybrid intelligent systems in equipment fault diagnosis.

AB  - This paper presents an intelligent agent model for simulating the behavior of a jazz bass player during live performance. In jazz performance, there is a strikingly large gap between the instructions given in a chord grid and the music actually being played. To bridge this gap, we integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods within the intelligent agent paradigm, focusing on two critical aspects. First, the experience acquired by musicians in terms of previously heard or played melodic fragments, which are stored in the agent's ''musical memory''. Second, the use of these known fragments within the evolving context of live improvisation. In previous papers, we have presented a model for an improvising bass player, emphasizing the underlying problem solving method. In this paper, we describe the fully implemented model and give more details on how melodic fragments are represented, indexed and retrieved. © 1999, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper aims at integrating the work on analogical reasoning in Cognitive Science into the long trend of philosophical interest, in this century, in analogical reasoning as a basis for scientific modeling. In the first part of the paper, three simulations of analogical reasoning, proposed in cognitive science, are presented: Gentner's Structure Matching Engine, Mitchel's and Hofstadter's COPYCAT and the Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine, proposed by Holyoak and Thagard. The differences and controversial points in these simulations are highlighted in order to make explicit their presuppositions concerning the nature of analogical reasoning. In the last part, this debate in cognitive science is applied to some traditional philosophical accounts of formal and material analogies as a basis for scientific modeling, like Mary Hesse's, and to more recent ones, that already draw from the work in Artificial Intelligence, like that proposed by Aronson, Harré and Way. © 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

An artificial neural network is developed to calculate a membership set for model parameters. Techniques of fuzzy logic control lead the network to its equilibrium points. Simulated examples are presented as an illustration of the proposed technique. The result represent a significant improvement over previously proposed methods. © 1999 IMACS/Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The use of a linguistic representation for expressing knowledge acquired by learning systems is an important issue as regards to user understanding. Under this assumption, and to make sure that these systems will be welcome and used, several techniques have been developed by the artificial intelligence community, under both the symbolic and the connectionist approaches. This work discusses and investigates three knowledge extraction techniques based on these approaches. The first two techniques, the C4.5 and CN2 symbolic learning algorithms, extract knowledge directly from the data set. The last technique, the TREPAN algorithm extracts knowledge from a previously trained neural network. The CN2 algorithm induces if...then rules from a given data set. The C4.5 algorithm extracts decision trees, although it can also extract ordered rules, from the data set. Decision trees are also the knowledge representation used by the TREPAN algorithm.

AB  - The problem of obtaining a network configuration of minimum energy losses for electric power distribution systems is addressed. It can be regarded as a generalization of the minimum spanning tree problem, where edge costs varies as the configuration changes. A solution is found with a recursive two-step procedure: the constraint of radial operation is relaxed in the first step, leading to an optimistic solution (a lower bound); information from this approximate solution is used in the second step to approach a feasible optimal solution. Non-linear network flow optimization techniques team with search strategies from the field of artificial intelligence to cope with computation intractability. Parallel processing speeds the search of optimal solutions. A case study sheds light on the possibilities and limitations of the procedure.

AB  - The multi-agent systems paradigm represents one of the most promising approaches to the development of agile scheduling systems in manufacturing. Innovative and balanced perspectives of multi-agent approaches to agile scheduling are discussed in this paper, and several achieved results and current developments are described. The description of the multi-agent framework emphasizes the use of negotiation mechanism to improve the scheduling flexibility, as well as the aspects of information integration, communication and coordination in a community of agents. For information integration and management various approaches are addressed and the utilization of a distributed/federated database management system is suggested. Finally, some innovative aspects for agile scheduling are introduced, particularly in the context of virtual enterprise environments.

AB  - This paper deals with the problem of linear gate assignment in two layout styles: one-dimensional logic array and gate matrix layout. The goal is to find the optimal sequencing of gates in order to minimize the required number of tracks, and thus to reduce the overall circuit layout area. This is known to be an NP-Hard optimization problem, for whose solution no absolute approximation algorithm exists. Here we report the use of a new optimization heuristic derived from statistical mechanics-the microcanonical optimization algorithm, fiO-to solve the linear gate assignment problem. Our numerical results show that juO compares favorably with at least five previously employed heuristics: simulated annealing, the unidirectional and the bidirectional Hong construction methods, and the artificial intelligence heuristics G M Plan and G M Learn. We also show how the algorithm is able to outperform microcanonical annealing. Moreover, in a massive set of experiments with circuits whose optimal layout is not known, our algorithm has been able to match and even to improve, by as much as seven tracks, the best solutions known so far. © 1999 IEEE.

AB  - We present in this paper an algorithm that infers data-flow for programs written in Logic language. No declaration about data-flow is required from the user. Basically, the algorithm consists of a symbolic execution of a program in order to find out data-flow directions for all predicate argument positions. It handles ground, no-ground and partially ground arguments, where the latter ones may occur in compound arguments. The data-flow directions are synthesized from a given program and a proposed goal. If an argument is a compound type argument it can have multiple data-flow directions, instead of a unique one. It happens when this argument is partially ground.

AB  - This paper deals with the problem of linear gate assignment in two layout styles: one-dimensional logic array and gate matrix layout. The goal is to find the optimal sequencing of gates in order to minimize the required number of tracks, and thus to reduce the overall circuit layout area. This is known to be an NP-Hard optimization problem, for whose solution no absolute approximation algorithm exists. Here we report the use of a new optimization heuristic derived from statistical mechanics - the microcanomical optimization algorithm, μO - to solve the linear gate assignment problem. Our numerical results show that μO compares favorably with at least five previously employed heuristics: simulated annealing, the unidirectional and the bidirectional Hong construction methods, and the artificial intelligence heuristics GM_Plan and GM_Learn. We also show how the algorithm is able to outperform microcanonical annealing. Moreover, in a massive set of experiments with circuits whose optimal layout is not known, our algorithm has been able to match and even to improve, by as much as seven tracks, the best solutions known so far.

AB  - The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is one of the most successfull techniques that have been used to recognize faces in images. This technique consists of extracting the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of an image from a covariance matrix, which is constructed from an image database. These eigenvectors and eigenvalues are used for image classification, obtaining nice results as far as face recognition is concerned. However, the high computational cost is a major problem of this technique, mainly when real-time applications are involved. There are some evidences that the performance of a PCA-based system that uses only the region around the eyes as input is very close to a system that uses the whole face. In this case, it is possible to implement faster PCA-based face recognition systems, because only a small region of the image is considered. This paper reports some results that corroborate this thesis, which have been obtained within the context of an ongoing project for the development of a performance assessment framework for face recognition systems. The results of two PCA-based recognition experiments are reported: the first one considers a more complete face region (from the eyebrows to the chin), while the second is a sub-region of the first, containing only the eyes. Themain contributions of the present paper are the description of the performance assessment framework (which is still under development), the results of the two experiments and a discussion of some possible reasons for them. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.

AB  - This work presents a real time system for detection and tracking of facial features in video sequences. Such system may be used in visual communication applications, such as teleconferencing, virtual reality, intelligent interfaces, human machine interaction, surveillance, etc. We have used a statistical skin-color model to segment face-candidate regions in the image. The presence or absence of a face in each region is verified by means of an eye detector, based on an efficient template matching scheme. Once a face is detected, the pupils, nostrils and lip corners are located and these facial features are tracked in the image sequence, performing real time processing. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.

AB  - One of the new research tendencies within the well-established cluster computing area is the growing interest in the use of multiple workstation clusters as a single virtual parallel machine, in much the same way as individual workstations are nowadays connected to build a single parallel cluster. In this paper we present an analysis on several aspects concerning the integration of different workstation clusters, such as Myrinet and SCI, and propose our MultiCluster model as an alternative to achieve such integrated architecture. © 2000 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - We propose a general framework for combining mobile processes and declarative programming languages, e.g., functional, logic or functional-logic languages. In contrast to existing concurrent extensions of declarative languages, we distinguish clearly between the notion of processes and that of functions or predicates. Thus, our framework is generic and may be applied to extend several kinds of declarative languages. It also extends PA process algebra in order to deal with parameter passing, mobile processes and interactive declarative programming. In our setting, declarative programs are dynamic and may be modified thanks to the actions performed by processes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.

AB  - In the Web, there are classes of pages with similar structuring and contents (e.g., call for papers pages, references, etc), which are interrelated forming clusters (e.g., Science). We propose an architecture of cognitive multi-agent systems for information retrieval and extraction from these clusters. Each agent processes one class employing reusable ontologies to recognize pages, extract all possible useful information and communicate with the others agents. Whenever it identifies information interesting to another agent, it forwards this information to that agent. These "hot hints" usually contain much less garbage than search engine results do. The agent architecture presents many sorts of reuse: all the code, DB definitions, knowledge and services of the search engines. We got promising results using Java and Jess. © Springer-Verlag 2000.

AB  - Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence provide suitable techniques to improve computer games quality. While the former offers mechanisms to model environment and characters' physical features, the latter provides models and tools for building characters, namely Synthetic Actors or Believable Agents, which can exhibit intelligent social behaviour and express personality and emotions. The current architecture proposals for Synthetic Actors do not fully meet the requirements for long-term games development, such as strategy and adventure ones, it is necessary to guarantee both personality stability and reactive emotional responses, which may be contradictory. In this work, we propose a new Synthetic Actor model that tightly connects emotions and social attitudes to personality, providing a long-term coherent behaviour. This model has been applied to two games presented here as case studies. © Springer-Verlag London Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes a drug ordering decision support system that helps with the prevention of adverse drug events by detecting drug-drug interactions in drug orders. The architecture of the system was devised in order to facilitate its use attached to physician order entry systems. The described model focuses in issues related to knowledge base maintenance and integration with external systems. Finally, a retrospective study was performed. Two knowledge bases, developed by different academic centers, were used to detect drug-drug interactions in a dataset with 37,237 drug prescriptions. The study concludes that the proposed knowledge base architecture enables content from other knowledge sources to be easily transferred and adapted to its structure. The study also suggests a method that can be used on the evaluation and refinement of the content of drug knowledge bases.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of an original hierarchical neural model on a complex sequence - the complete sixteenth four-part fugue in G minor of the Well-Tempered Clavier (vol. I) of J. S. Bach. The model makes an effective use of context information, through its hierarchical topology and its embedded time integrators, and that enables it to keep a very good account of past events. The model performs sequence classification and discrimination efficiently. It has application in domains which require pattern recognition, or particularly, which demand recognising either a set of sequences of vectors in time, or suh-sequences into a unique and large sequence of vectors in time.

AB  - Bongard problems present an outstanding challenge to artificial intelligence. They consist of visual pattern understanding problems on which the task of the pattern perceiver is to find an abstract aspect of distinction between two classes of figures. This paper examines the philosophical question of whether objects in Bongard problems can be ascribed an a priori, metaphysical, existence - the ontological question of whether objects, and their boundaries, come pre-defined, independently of any understanding or context. This is an essential issue, because it determines whether a priori symbolic representations can be of use for solving Bongard problems. The resulting conclusion of this analysis is that in the case of Bongard problems there can be no units ascribed an a priori existence - and thus the objects dealt with in any specific problem must be found by solution methods (rather than given to them). This view ultimately leads to the emerging alternatives to the philosophical doctrine of metaphysical realism.

AB  - We propose a communication technique that uses modeling of language in the encoding-decoding process of message transmission. A temporal partition (time-delay coarse graining of the phase space based on the symbol sequence statistics) is introduced with little if any intervention required for the targeting of the trajectory. Message transmission is performed by means of codeword, i.e., specific targeting instructions are sent to the receiver rather than the explicit message. This approach yields (i) error correction availability for transmission in the presence of noise or dropouts, (ii) transmission in a compressed format, (iii) a high level of security against undesirable detection, and (iv) language recognition. © 2000 The American Physical Society.

AB  - We are concerned in this paper with learning classification procedures from known cases. More precisely, we provide a diagnostic model that discriminate between cerebellum-pontine angle (CPA) tumors and otorhinolaryngological (ENT) disorders. Usually, in order to distinguish between CPA tumors and ENT disorders one must perform clinical-neurological examination together with expensive radiological imagery (CT and MRI). The proposed model was obtained through artificial intelligence methods and presented a good accuracy level (88.4%) when tested against new cases, considering only clinical examination without radiological imagery results.

AB  - Autonomous learning techniques are based on experience acquisition. In most realistic applications, experience is time-consuming: it implies sensor reading, actuator control and algorithmic update, constrained by the learning system dynamics. The information crudeness upon which classical learning algorithms operate make such problems too difficult and unrealistic. Nonetheless, additional information for facilitating the learning process ideally should be embedded in such a way that the structural, well-studied characteristics of these fundamental algorithms are maintained. We investigate in this article a more general formulation of the Q-learning method that allows for a spreading of information derived from single updates towards a neighbourhood of the instantly visited state and converges to optimality. We show how this new formulation can be used as a mechanism to safely embed prior knowledge about the structure of the state space, and demonstrate it in a modified implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm in a real robot navigation task.

AB  - Based on an industrial survey with experts, this paper discusses relevant aspects regarding the way in which fluid power systems are designed. The paper briefly describes a computational support tool, developed as a prototype, to improve the design process in this area. The description includes issues of knowledge representation, domain selection, the expert system design process and validation; it also presents a development time frame and industrial potential related to the system. The paper suggests ways of applying such system in order to provide a training facility for new engineers and an empowering tool for experiencing designers, to integrate different knowledge sources in a computational environment, and to apply Internet technologies to facilitate communications among design agents.

AB  - One of the major interests in soil analysis is the evaluation of its chemical, physical and biological parameters, which are indicators of soil quality (the most important is the organic matter). Besides there is a great interest in the study of humic substances and on the assessment of pollutants, such as pesticides and heavy metals, in soils. Chemometrics is a powerful tool to deal with these problems and can help soil researchers to extract much more information from their data. In spite of this, the presence of these kinds of strategies in the literature has obtained projection only recently. The utilization of chemometric methods in soil analysis is evaluated in this article. The applications will be divided in four parts (with emphasis in the first two): (i) descriptive and exploratory methods based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA); (ii) multivariate calibration methods (MLR, PCR and PLS); (iii) methods such as Evolving Factor Analysis and SIMPLISMA; and (iv) artificial intelligence methods, such as Artificial Neural Networks.

AB  - We present in this paper an approach to providing cooperativeness in database querying using artificial intelligence techniques. The main focus is a cooperative interface that assists nonexperienced and casual users in extracting useful answers from a relational database. Our approach relies on an architecture that comprises two knowledge bases which store rules that describe the application domain and guide the process of query formulation and answering. A subset of SQL is used for expressing queries, and the cooperative interface relieves the user from knowing its full syntax and the structure of the database.

AB  - This article investigates the computation of posterior upper expectations induced by imprecise probabilities, with emphasis on the effects of irrelevance and independence judgements. Algorithms that handle imprecise priors and imprecise likelihoods are reviewed, and a new result on the limiting divergence of posterior upper probabilities is presented. Algorithms that handle irrelevance and independence relations in multivariate models are analyzed through graphical representations, inspired by the popular Bayesian network model. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Expert systems are among the most practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI). An expert system with a concurrent engineering perspective can support the design of hydraulic systems. Hydraulic systems are made up of pre-engineered components that each has a specific function. Design procedures for hydraulic systems are very important for developing expert systems, and the component-oriented nature of fluid power systems is an ideal fit.

AB  - Robotic soccer has been adopted as a standard problem so that various theories, algorithms, models, performance, and architectures can be evaluated and a wide range of technologies needs to be integrated, promoting both robotics and AI research. This paper describes our experience in these aspects, providing detailed description of the software modules adopted in the construction of the GUARANA robot-soccer team, one of the Brazilian teams at FIRA'98 Games - Federation of International Robot-soccer Association. First we describe the vision layer, composed of an off-line calibration phase and an on-line real-time identification and tracking phase. Then, the strategic layer is detailed, which is based on the information passed from the vision layer and the stored information about the soccer domain. It decides the robot actions to be executed, given in terms of velocity and navigation direction. Finally, we give an overall description of the hardware architecture used. At FIRA'98 Games, held in Paris, France, The GUARANA team performed well, and won the worldwide vice-championship in the MIROSOT category (Micro-Robot Soccer Tournament).

AB  - This work proposes an interaction between a heat transfer model and an artificial intelligence (AI) heuristic search method which is linked to a Knowledge Basis for the optimization of a Laser Transformation Hardening (LTH) process. The developed computational program selects the best combinations of laser operational variables for the highest martensitic production and for laser energy saving. The mathematical model consists on an analytical part to describe the workpiece laser heating and a numerical part for the cooling process. The Knowledge Basis is a rule-based system constituted of heat treatment constraints. The use of the developed search method for determining optimized laser operational variables can be considered a very effective tool in the improvement of the LTH process performance.

AB  - There is a difference between rules and principles in Law Argumentation Theory. The conflict of rules is solved by meta-rules like Lex Superior (based in general hierarchical structure of legal system), Lex Posterior (based on later rule priority), Lex Specialis (based on specification of rules) and also by exceptions, which exclude the conflict. The collisions of rules imply the validity negation of one rule. However, this does not occur in a collision of principles. Even when one principle is not applied by collisions, its validity remains. Another point is that the priority could change, changing the overridden principle. So, it is necessary to build a reasoning model that allows reasoning with conflicting legal principles. Another problem is vagueness of principles. Vagueness does not mean just an imprecise meaning, linguistically talking. There should be attributed a semantic, or a pragmatic meaning. Vagueness of principles occurs on account of its opened antecedent, with no established conduct. In this paper a model of reasoning using Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Law methods is described aiming at treating vagueness and collisions of principles, searching to establish rationality in legal argumentation systems. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Since there is no individual approach that can be universally applied to effectively solve the hard problems of artificial intelligence and data analysis, hybrid systems are necessary to better tackle specific tasks by exploiting the advantages of different methodologies in a single framework. Based on known results of combining neural networks and rule-based systems, this work presents a hybrid system with the purpose of simplifying rule sets obtained from rule induction algorithms on classification problems without increasing the accuracy error. This is motivated by assuming that simplicity can lead to more understandable models and rule induction algorithms often provide an excessive number of rules necessary to classify future examples within a given accuracy error, even after pruning. Experimental evidence suggests effective gains on a benchmark of sixteen data sets. Experiments were also performed to detect the effect of different components of the proposed approach in achieving the results and so helping to explain why this hybrid system works. © 2001-IOS Press.

AB  - An artificial neural network with a two-layer feedback topology and generalized recurrent neurons, for solving nonlinear discrete dynamic optimization problems, is developed. A direct method to assign the weights of neural networks is presented. The method is based on Bellmann's Optimality Principle and on the interchange of information which occurs during the synaptic chemical processing among neurons. The neural network based algorithm is an advantageous approach for dynamic programming due to the inherent parallelism of the neural networks; further it reduces the severity of computational problems that can occur in methods like conventional methods. Some illustrative application examples are presented to show how this approach works out including the shortest path and fuzzy decision making problems.

AB  - The appropriate operation of a radial basis function (RBF) neural network depends mainly upon an adequate choice of the parameters of its basis functions. The simplest approach to train an RBF network is to assume fixed radial basis functions defining the activation of the hidden units. Once the RBF parameters are fixed, the optimal set of output weights can be determined straightforwardly by using a linear least squares algorithm, which generally means reduction in the learning time as compared to the determination of all RBF network parameters using supervised learning. The main drawback of this strategy is the requirement of an efficient algorithm to determine the number, position, and dispersion of the RBFs. The approach proposed here is inspired by models derived from the vertebrate immune system, that will be shown to perform unsupervised cluster analysis. The algorithm is introduced and its performance is compared to that of the random, k-means center selection procedures and other results from the literature. By automatically defining the number of RBF centers, their positions and dispersions, the proposed method leads to parsimonious solutions. Simulation results are reported concerning regression and classification problems.

AB  - The general interest in the web as a medium for sharing and distributing information has reached formal education. Recent literature has discussed several modalities of educational application for computer-mediated communication technologies. The use of these new technologies is not seen in the same proportion in the workplace. This work addresses the learning opportunities which the internet media can bring to the process of continual development of people at work. Particular reference is made to the design of the Dice Game, a multi-user synchronous simulation game for manufacturing training.

AB  - In a trading scenario agents Interact with each other, selling and buying resources. In order to control the behavior of the trading scenario, the interactions must be coordinated. We present a brief discussion of communication types and coordination models applicable in multi-agent systems. We find a programmable tuple space more appropriate to manage and rule the interactions between the trading agents. We discuss the advantages of a trading agent model that deals with the trading strategy, concentrating on what to buy or sell. This relieves the agent from the task of coordinating the negotiations and their revoking or acceptances. This is the task of the programmable tuple space.

AB  - This paper describes research investigating the evolution of coordination strategies in robot soccer teams. Each player (viewed as an agent) is provided with a common set of skills and is assigned to perform over a delimited area inside a soccer field. The idea is to optimize the whole team behavior by means of a spatial coadaptation process in which new players are selected in such a way to comply with the already existing ones. The main results show that, through coevolution, we progressively create teams whose members act on complementary areas of the playing field, being capable of prevailing over a standard opponent team with a fixed formation. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of cognitive character animation. We propose the use of finite state machines for the behavioral control of characters. Our approach rests on the idea that the cognitive character arises from the evolutionary computation embedded in the artificial life simulation, which in our case is implemented by the finite state machine. We present some of the results of the WOXBOT/ARENA research project. This project to build virtual worlds is aimed at the graphic simulation of an arena, where small mobile robots can perform requested tasks while behaving according to their own motivation and reasoning. Each robot is an intelligent agent that perceives the virtual environment through a simulated vision system and reacts by moving away from or approaching the object it sees. The conception and specification of the robots and environment are being done very carefully to create an open distributed object architecture that could serve as a test-bed freely available and ready to use for testing theories in some computational areas such as evolutionary computation, artificial life, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, cognitive neurosciences and distributed objects architectures. Furthermore, it is a first step towards building a cognitive animated character. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The rule-based approach from traditional AI and the conventional constraint satisfaction algorithms are not adequate to cope with the unpredictable events and interactive computations in distributed CAD environments. This paper claims that the problems faced by distributed CAD systems require solutions based on the concepts of emergence, reactivity, and online algorithms. The present paper presents Extended Constraints Graphs (ECGs) as online algorithms supporting emergence in a network of reactive agents. ECGs represent an effective solution for the nonlinear constraint problem in cyclic graphs, which are distributed over a heterogeneous computer network. The relationships between agents in an ECG are generic, distributed, recursive and nonlinear - a problem not solved in the literature. Also this paper presents a CORBA model integrated with a Geometry Bus to support distributed virtual prototype whose variables can be defined in terms of ECGs. © 2001 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This work proposes an interaction between a numerical heat transfer model and an artificial intelligence (AI) heuristic search method which is linked to a Knowledge Base for the continuous casting of quality billets (SAE 1010 steel). A two-dimensional heat transfer model was developed using a finite difference method and was applied to real dimensions of a steel billet continuous caster. The Knowledge Base consists of technological and metallurgical constraints. The heuristic search method, aided by the Knowledge Base, explores the space parameter settings in order to find optimized cooling conditions which results in defect free billet production with minimum metallurgical length. The use of the developed search method for determining optimum setting of cooling conditions demonstrated that very good results can be attained in assuring billet quality and in the improvement of caster performance.

AB  - This article is about applications that can be customized or extended through their own user interface. This is achieved by the interface's ability to interpret users' non-literal expressions, namely metaphorical and metonymic ones. Such increased interpretive intelligence depends on static and dynamic models of the domain and application, from which new figurative meanings are abducted automatically or semi-automatically. The system performs controlled modifications on the underlying models, based on inferences it draws about users' intentions as they produce figurative utterances.

AB  - An unsupervised neural network is proposed to learn and recall complex robot trajectories. Two cases are considered: (i) A single trajectory in which a particular arm configuration (state) may occur more than once, and (ii) trajectories sharing states with each other. Ambiguities occur in both cases during recall of such trajectories. The proposed model consists of two groups of synaptic weights trained by competitive and Hebbian learning laws. They are responsible for encoding spatial and temporal features of the input sequences, respectively. Three mechanisms allow the network to deal with repeated or shared states: local and global context units, neurons disabled from learning, and redundancy. The network reproduces the current and the next state of the learned sequences and is able to resolve ambiguities. The model was simulated over various sets of robot trajectories in order to evaluate learning and recall, trajectory sampling effects and robustness.

AB  - This work presents a hybrid expert system (HES) intended to minimise some complex problems pervasive to knowledge engineering such as: the knowledge elicitation process, known as the bottleneck of expert systems; the choice of a model for knowledge representation to codify human reasoning; the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the topology used in the connectionist approach; the difficulty to extract an explanation from the network. Two algorithms applied to developing of HES are also suggested. One of them is used to train the fuzzy neural network and the other to obtain explanations on how the fuzzy neural network attained a conclusion. A case study is presented (e.g. epileptic crisis) with the inclusion of problem definition and simulations. The results are also discussed. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - It is difficult to control and to manage the start-up of a petroleum offshore platform. In order to solve this problem an intelligent system can play an important role, since available qualitative operator and design knowledge can be easily implemented to assist the operator during start-up. This paper describes the integration of an expert system with a fuzzy controller applied to such a process. The intelligent system has many heuristic rules to implement the automation of the start-up procedures, like the opening of many on-off valves while simultaneously monitoring process variables. It also has a fuzzy controller to optimize the opening of the oil wells, in order to minimize the start-up time. This intelligent system is being implemented in the platform P-19 of Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company, in Campos Basin, Brazil. The prototype has been operating since October 1998. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper proposes a hybrid expert system (HES) to minimise some complexity problems pervasive to the artificial intelligence such as: the knowledge elicitation process, known as the bottleneck of expert systems; the model choice for knowledge representation to code human reasoning; the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the topology used in the connectionist approach; the difficulty to obtain the explanation on how the network arrived to a conclusion. Two algorithms applied to developing of HES are also suggested. One of them is used to train the fuzzy neural network and the other to obtain explanations on how the fuzzy neural network attained a conclusion. To overcome these difficulties the cognitive computing was integrated to the developed system. A case study is presented (e.g. epileptic crisis) with the problem definition and simulations. Results are also discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article describes an approach to an Intelligent Tutorial System - CARDIOLOG, specially developed to help in teaching electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation to medical students. Although the system can be used as a self-learning tool, one of its main characteristics is the adequacy to classroom environment - a Professor module and many Student's modules. Medical students and professors, physicians and people interested on the subject will be able to form a solid knowledge base or complement their studies with CARDIOLOG. The activities rely on user-friendly interfaces, based on the questions/answers model, with the possibility of consulting reference (if enabled by the professor). Analysis of students' performance, reports and knowledge base maintenance tools are also available in CARDIOLOG. CARDIOLOG was implemented using Artificial Intelligence technologies, development using object methodology, Client/Server structure, 32-bit Windows platform.

AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to present a procedure that utilizes 13C NMR for pattern recognition and substructure elucidation of monoterpenes. By this reason, a novel version of the REGRAS program was developed for the specialist SISTEMAT system. This program carries out an analysis of the 13C NMR data from a given compound and, from characteristic chemical shift ranges, recognizes the substructures and the skeleton present in a compound. At the end of this procedure, the program displays as analysis results the likely skeletons and substructures of the substance in question. The REGRAS program was tested on skeleton elucidation of 30 monoterpenes from the most varied skeleton types, exhibiting excellent results in skeleton and substructure prediction processes.

AB  - Load forecasting has become in recent years one of the major areas of research in electrical engineering, and most traditional forecasting models and artificial intelligence techniques have been tried out in this task. Artificial neural networks (NNs) have lately received much attention, and a great number of papers have reported successful experiments and practical tests with them. Nevertheless, some authors remain skeptical, and believe that the advantages of using NNs in forecasting have not been systematically proved yet. In order to investigate the reasons for such skepticism, this review examines a collection of papers (published between 1991 and 1999) that report the application of NNs to short-term load forecasting. Our aim is to help to clarify the issue, by critically evaluating the ways in which the NNs proposed in these papers were designed and tested.

AB  - This paper reports the development of a powerful and versatile laboratory for vision research, namely Σynergos, which has been developed and implemented under Delphi/Windows in a distributed systems of microcomputers. The main paradigm underlying the whole approach consists in integrating several concepts and techniques into a single computing environment, i.e. Σynergos, in such a way that the requisites and possibilities of each of the constituent components complement one another and the thus obtained result becomes greater than the sum of its parts. The components of Σynergos include distributed system capabilities and a number of libraries containing algorithms for: computer vision, modeling and simulation of biological visual systems, data and classification analysis, software validation and comparative evaluation, Internet, off-the-shelf application, image databases, artificial intelligence, data mining, and visualization resources. In this paper special emphasis is placed upon the Internet, distributed implementation and biological vision. After outlining the principal requisites and potentials underlying each of such components, some specific situations of interest arising from the integration of two or more of such elements are described and discussed. Details concerning the integration with Internet and the implementation of the laboratory as a distributed system are provided, and a complete case-example is presented. This applications regards the implementation of a psychophysical experiment aimed at investigating human perception of pictorial complexity, including the derivation of a mathematic-computational framework modeling such a perception as well as the use of the Internet as a source of stimuli and for reporting the obtained results. In addition, the mathematic-computational model is derived by using a parallel version of the genetic algorithm running on the distributed system of PCs. The obtained encouraging results substantiate the potential of this vision laboratory for multidisciplinary vision research.

AB  - Radiographic inspection is widely used in non-destructive testing for integrity evaluation of structures and equipments, especially for detection and characterisation of defects in welded joints. For this reason, research to optimise this technique has been increasing in recent years. As it is a technique that demands the inspector's vast experience and correct adjustment of inspection parameters, in many situations the final decision becomes a difficult task and subject to interpretation mistakes. With the progress of computer science and techniques of artificial intelligence and neural computation, efforts in several countries have been made seeking the development of an automatic system of inspection for X-rays or gamma-rays that optimises the interpretation of welding defects. This work presents a way to obtain the best hierarchical and non-hierarchical linear discriminators for classification of the principal welding defects, using a neural network technique for implementation. The results prove the efficiency of the techniques used in the work.

AB  - Nowadays, it is very important for retail companies to understand their customers and establish a good relationship with them. It is then crucial to be able to segment the customers according to their buying patterns and needs. Unfortunately, this is not an easy task, requiring the consideration of several different mathematical techniques. In this work, a database from a long distance telephone company containing client-calling patterns was clustered and characterized. First, the Kohonen algorithm was used to cluster a subset of the database. Then, the clusters extracted were characterized using rules and some statistical visualization techniques. Finally, a classification model, based on neural networks, was built to classify future customers into the clusters extracted.

AB  - Artificial neural networks (ANN) were used as the alternative procedure for the risk assessment of power systems. The approach was found to be useful where the exchange of information among utilities might be subjected to hindrances due to conflict of interests, time constraints or lack of data. The suggested technique was able to evaluate risk indices in a per bus basis. The procedure also exhibited excellent results during the estimation of expected energy not supplied (EENS).

AB  - We introduce a global optimization procedure, the neural-assisted genetic algorithm (NAGA). It combines the power of an artificial neural network (ANN) with the versatility of the genetic algorithm. This method is suitable to solve optimization problems that depend on some kind of heuristics to limit the search space. If a reasonable amount of data is available, the ANN can “understand” the problem and provide the genetic algorithm with a selected population of elements that will speed up the search for the optimum solution. We tested the method in a search for the ground-state geometry of silicon clusters. We trained the ANN with information about the geometry and energetics of small silicon clusters. Next, the ANN learned how to restrict the configurational space for larger silicon clusters. For [Formula Presented] and [Formula Presented] we noticed that the NAGA is at least three times faster than the “pure” genetic algorithm. As the size of the cluster increases, it is expected that the gain in terms of time will increase as well. 5555 2002 The American Physical Society.

AB  - We present a new approach to design fault tolerant artificial neural networks (ANNs). Additionally, this approach allows estimating the final network reliability. This approach is based on the mutation analysis technique and is used during the training process of the ANN. The basic idea is to train the ANN in the presence of faults (single-fault model is assumed). To do so, a set of faults is injected into the code describing the ANN. This procedure yields mutation versions of the original ANN code, which in turn are used to train the network in an iterative process with the designer until the moment when the ANN is no longer sensible to the single faults injected. In other words, the network became tolerant to the considered set of faults. A practical example where an ANN is used to recognize an electrocardiogram (ECG) and to measure ECG parameters illustrates the proposed methodology. © 2000 IEEE.

AB  - Text categorization is a process of classifying documents with regard to a group of one or more existent categories according to themes or concepts present in their contents. The most common application of it is in information retrieval systems (IRS) to document indexing. A method to transform text categorization into a viable task is to use machine-learning algorithms to automate text classification, allowing it to be carried out fast, into concise manner and in broad range. The objective of this work is to present and compare the results of experiments on text categorization using artificial neural networks of multilayer perceptron and self-organizing map types, and traditional machine-learning algorithms used in this task: C4.5 decision tree, PART decision rules and Naive Bayes classifier. © 2002 IEEE.

AB  - We introduce a translation of a conditional logic semantics to a mathematical programming problem. A model of 0-1 programming is used to compute the logical consequences of a conditional knowledge base, according to a chosen default theory semantics. The key to understanding this model of mathematical programming is to regard the task of the entailment of plausible conclusions as isomorphic to an instance of weighted MAX-SAT problem. Hence, we describe the use of combinatorial optimization algorithms in the task of defeasible reasoning over conditional knowledge bases. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.

AB  - Extracting meaningful knowledge from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is a current issue since, for several applications, the ability to explain the decisions taken by ANNs is even more important than their classification performance. Although some techniques have been suggested to solve this problem, a large number of these techniques can only be applied to some specific ANNs models. This paper proposes and investigates the use of symbolic learning algorithms, such as C.45, C4.5rules [13], and CN2 [4], to extract meaningful symbolic representations from trained ANNs. The main difference of this approach with other techniques previously proposed is that it can be applied to any supervised ANN model. The approach proposed is in some way similar to the one used by the Trepan algorithm [5], which extracts a symbolic representation, expressed as a decision tree, from a trained ANN. Experimental results are presented and discussed in order to compare the knowledge extracted from several ANNs using the proposed approach and the Trepan approach. Results are compared regarding two aspects: fidelity and comprehensibility. The results obtained show that our approach, using C4.5, C4.5rules and CN2 as symbolic learning algorithms, produces in general better comprehensible symbolic representation than Trepan for the trained ANNs considered in the experiments. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.

AB  - This paper describes a multiagent system for natural language processing that deals with task oriented dialogue processing in Portuguese. The system is based on Discourse Structure Theory, on Centering Theory and on Lochbaum?s work on modeling the Intentional Structure of the discourse. The dialogue takes place between the user and the system in such a way that the user plays the role of one participant and the system plays the other. Together, both the system and the user collaborate to achieve the goal the user had in mind when he/she initiated the dialogue. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.

AB  - In this paper we address the problem of multi-objective attribute selection in data mining. We propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) based on the wrapper approach to discover the best subset of attributes for a given classification algorithm, namely C4.5, a well-known decision-tree algorithm. The two objectives to be minimized are the error rate and the size of the tree produced by C4.5. The proposed GA is a multi-objective method in the sense that it discovers a set of non-dominated solutions (attribute subsets), according to the concept of Pareto dominance. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.

AB  - This paper presents an architecture for distributed control systems and its underlying methodological framework. Ideas and concepts of distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and soft computing are merged into a unique architecture to provide cooperation, flexibility, and adaptability required by knowledge processing in intelligent control systems. The distinguished features of the architecture include a local problem solving capability to handle the specific requirements of each part of the system, an evolutionary case-based mechanism to improve performance and optimize controls, the use of linguistic variables as means for information aggregation, and fuzzy set theory to provide local control. A distributed traffic control system application is discussed to provide the details of the architecture, and to emphasize its usefulness. The performance of the distributed control system is compared with conventional control approaches under a variety of traffic situations. © 2002 KSAE.

AB  - This paper evaluates the performance of three popular technologies used to interconnect machines on clusters: Fast Ethernet, Myrinet and Giganet. To achieve this purpose, we used the NAS Parallel Benchmarks. Surprisingly, for the LU application, the performance of Fast Ethernet was better than Myrinet. We also evaluate the performance gains provided by VIA, a user lever communication protocol, when compared with TCP/IP, a traditional, stacked-based communication protocol. The impacts caused by the use of Remote DMA Write are also evaluated. The results show that Fast Ethernet, when combined with a high performance communication protocol, such as VIA, has a good cost-benefit ratio, and can be a good choice to connect machines on a small cluster environment where bandwidth is not crucial for applications. © 2002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this paper, the ambient temperature values and load signals are applied in an architecture of artificial neural network with the objective of estimating the internal temperature of oil-immersed distribution transformers. The architecture of neural network used in this application is a multilayer perceptron. The training of the network was carried-out using the "Resilient Propagation" algorithm and it was based on design details and experimental data relative to the oil-immersed distribution transformers. Simulation results of the proposed approach indicate that this methodology can be efficiently used in the protection processes of transformers, increasing the selectivity, reliability and the management of the electric energy distribution system.

AB  - The use of Fuzzy Logic to solve control problems have been increasing considerably in the past years. The successfulness of fuzzy application depends on a number of parameters, such as fuzzy membership functions, that are usually decided upon subjectively. One way to improve the performance of the fuzzy reasoning model is the use of genetic algorithm. In this paper it is shown that a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm learning mechanism, supplements the performance of fuzzy reasoning model. The PSO is able to generate an optimal set of parameters for fuzzy reasoning model based on either, their initial subjective selection, or on a random selection. The purpose of this paper is to present and discuss a strategy for the membership functions automatic adjustment, using PSO algorithms, and presents an application designed to park a vehicle into a garage, beginning from any start position.

AB  - The simulation technique has been used to solve many problems that occur in the production process. Whenever an event occurs, many alternatives (scenarios) can be generated in order to solve the problem. However, as much as the number of scenarios to be simulated becomes higher, the time spent in this process raises, implicating in a difficult task to find a good solution. Hence, it is necessary to reduce this number of scenarios. In this context, it is proposed an approach to reduce the number of scenarios to be simulated, grouping similar scenarios in sets, through the use of fuzzy logic.

AB  - The task of controlling urban traffic requires flexibility, adaptability, and handling of uncertain information spread through the urban network. The use of fuzzy sets, case-based mechanisms, and genetic algorithms in a distributed system framework can provide the necessary foundations for an efficient and adaptable on-line traffic control system. In this paper we present a distributed traffic control system built upon a fuzzy, adaptive framework. A traffic network consisting of 16 traffic lights in six intersections was implemented and compared with conventional traffic control approaches. Simulation results show that the distributed system outperforms current traffic engineering strategies.

AB  - An overview is given on the possibility of controlling the status of circuit breakers (CB) in a substations with the use of a knowledge base that relates some of the operation magnitudes, mixing status variables with time variables and fuzzy sets. It is shown that even when all the magnitudes to be controlled cannot be included in the analysis, it is possible to control the desired status while supervising some important magnitudes as the voltage, power factor, and harmonic distortion, as well as the present status.

AB  - This paper reports on the development of an economic market simulator using mobile agents. Agents are specialized software programs that can move autonomously between supporting platforms. Agents can be used to model the preferences of users wishing to buy or sell items on a global marketplace. Users can select a number of options that will guide the agents in their quest for an optimal trade. Besides the price range, users can determine the way in which the agents will bargain, thus fine-tuning the tradeoffs involved in deciding whether a price in the price range requires further negotiation or is acceptable. The simulation developed is realized entirely in Java, and takes advantage of TEEMA, an extensible, general-purpose mobile agent execution environment, dedicated to the purpose of exploring the capabilities of mobile agents. TEEMA has been realized to provide a testbed for agent applications without having to be limited by proprietary application suites or inaccessible low-level interfaces. It is completely configurable and easily extensible as it is built around a microkernel that supports primitive agent operations and a set of services that provide high-level agent support. The paper starts with the description of the infrastructure necessary to define a marketplace as a combination of service agents. Then, trader agents are explained. The simulation environment is then introduced, and analyzed. The architecture emerging from the simulation environment is then examined, together with its advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the simulation parameters are presented. An analysis of the results shows that the simulation environment can provide a suitable platform for economic simulation based on empirical analysis or more formal systems such as game theory. An example of asymmetric transaction is presented where it is shown that trades are influenced by the agent initiating the transaction.

AB  - In this work is presented a new proposal for solving the reactive power dispatch. The approach is based on the (μ + λ)-ES paradigm improved by the control of mutations and by using of Cauchy-based mutation rather than the classical Gaussian Mutations (GMs). Others variants are also implemented and a comparative study are performed. Good and reliable performance have been achieved and validation tests using the standard IEEE118 system are reported. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Shrinkage occurs In all polymers, being extremely dependent on processing conditions. The utilization of shrinkage data allows designers to accurately predict the final part dimensions. A numerical prediction of a part shrinkage can be made using simulation packages available commercially. However, this shrinkage is highly dependent on the non-linear material behavior and, thus, its estimation involves significant simplifications. On the other hand, artificial neural networks, ANN, can model highly non-linear systems; thus, it is expected that they can predict a part shrinkage effectively. In this study, a neural network architecture was developed to predict the shrinkage of an iPP injection molded plaque after changing four processing conditions: melt and mold temperatures, holding pressure and flow rate. The experiments were defined through the use of the design of experiments. A simulation code, Moldflow®, was used to establish the processing window; its shrinkage predictions were compared with experimental, neural network and statistical results. It was observed that the ANN had the best performance in the shrinkage prediction, even using limited experimental data, confirming its great capacity to model non-linear systems.

AB  - The productivity and quality of a continuous caster depend mainly on process parameters, i.e. casting speed, casting temperature, steel composition and cleanliness of the melt, water flow rates in the different cooling zones, etc. This work presents the development of an algorithm, which incorporates heuristic search techniques for direct application in metallurgical industries, particularly those using continuous casting process for the production of steel billets and slabs. This is done to determine the casting objectives of maximum casting rate as a function of casting constraints. These constraints are evaluated with the aid of a heat transfer and solidification model based on the finite difference technique, which has been developed and integrated with a genetic algorithm. The essential parts of continuous casting equipment, which must be subjected to monitoring, as well as a methodology of mathematical model and physical settlements in each cooling region, are presented. The efficiency of the intelligent system is assured by the optimisation of the continuous casting operation by maximum casting rate and defect-free products. This approach is applied to the real dimension of a steel continuous caster, in real conditions of operation, demonstrating that good results can be attained by using heuristic search, such as: smaller temperature gradients between sprays zones, reduction in water consumption and an increase in casting speed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Mutation testing (Mutation Analysis), although powerful in revealing faults, is considered a computationally expensive criterion, due to the high number of mutants created and the effort to determine the equivalent mutants. Using mutation-based alternative testing criteria it is possible to reduce the number of mutants but it is still necessary to determine the equivalent ones. In this paper the Bayesian Learning (one of the Artificial Intelligence techniques used in machine learning) is investigated to define the Bayesian Learning-Based Equivalent Detection Technique (BaLBEDeT), which provides guidelines to help the tester to analyze the live mutants in order to determine the equivalent ones.

AB  - Traditional methods for data mining typically make the assumption that data is centralized and static. This assumption is no longer tenable. Such methods waste computational and I/O resources when the data is dynamic, and they impose excessive communication overhead when the data is distributed. As a result, the knowledge discovery process is harmed by slow response times. Efficient implementation of incremental data mining ideas in distributed computing environments is thus becoming crucial for ensuring scalability and facilitating knowledge discovery when data is dynamic and distributed. In this paper we address this issue in the context of frequent itemset mining, an important data mining task. Frequent itemsets are most often used to generate correlations and association rules, but more recently they have been used in such far-reaching domains as bio-informatics and e-commerce applications. We first present an efficient algorithm which dynamically maintains the required information in the presence of data updates without examining the entire dataset. We then show how to parallelize the incremental algorithm, so that it can asynchronously mine frequent itemsets. We also propose a distributed algorithm, which imposes low communication overhead for mining distributed datasets. Several experiments confirm that our algorithm results in excellent execution time improvements. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - In this article we present a case study comparison of the implementation characteristics of two software environments that are well known in grid computing configurations. We evaluate the performance of these environments during the execution of distributed parallel MPI tasks. Therefore, first we consider some concepts of the grid paradigm and then we present a comparison between the two software environments. Our case study is based on the Globus and Legion environments, because these two research projects are in more developed stage when compared to others research initiatives. Our experimental results indicate that the grid computing approach can be interesting to execute distributed parallel MPI applications with a performance improvement. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - This paper presents a language designed for the description of both temporal schema versioning and schema modification in object-oriented databases. The language supports temporal and versions features in both schemata and data levels. An extension of the ODMG standard is presented in order to incorporate temporal and versioning features into ODL language to properly manage the schema evolution mechanism. Thus, this proposal improves the database environment with temporal and versioning features concerning database modification. The solution to the problem is shown to be feasible since it is defined in terms of the ODMG standard. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - A tester relies on some sort of contract between the users and the implementers of a system. The contract defines the obligations of each part that are partially checked by selecting and executing test-cases. In fact, these test-cases are contracts, too, although in a rather operational form. In this article we define the general relationship between these two forms of contract and present a method how various test-selection strategies can be defined formally. More precisely, we demonstrate how test-cases can be calculated from contracts using a refinement calculus. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Pairing-based cryptosystems depend on the existence of groups where the Decision Diffie-Hellman problem is easy to solve, but the Computational Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. Such is the case of elliptic curve groups whose embedding degree is large enough to maintain a good security level, but small enough for arithmetic operations to be feasible. However, the embedding degree for most elliptic curves is enormous, and the few previously known suitable elliptic curves have embedding degree k ≤ 6. In this paper, we examine criteria for curves with larger k that generalize prior work by Miyaji et al. based on the properties of cyclotomic polynomials, and propose efficient representations for the underlying algebraic structures. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Since little is still known about fundamental brain mechanisms associated to thought, its different manifestations are usually classified in an oversimplified way into normal and abnormal, like delusional and disorganized thought or creative thinking. Considering dopaminergic signal-to-noise neuronal modulation in the central nervous system, and the existence of semantic maps in the human brain, we developed a self-organizing neural network model to unify different thought processes into a single neurocomputational substrate. We performed simulations varying dopaminergic modulation and observed the total patterns that emerged at the resulting semantic map, assuming that these correspond to thought. The model thus shows how normal and abnormal thinking are generated, and that there are no clear borders between their different manifestations. Actually, a continuum of different qualitative reasoning, ranging from delusion to disorganized thought, and passing through normal and creative thinking, seems to be more plausible. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Different splitting techniques are applied in the context of semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit approach to develop computationally efficient scheme. Vertical decoupling permits to apply simpler explicit calculations for slow vertical modes and transforms the 3D elliptic equation arising on each time step of the scheme to a set of 2D elliptic problems. By time splitting, the last are reduced to 1D problems, which admit an efficient direct solver. Finally, the space splitting diminishes the amount of operations due to approximation of the physically insignificant terms with lower order of accuracy. Application of these techniques results in an efficient scheme with time step chosen according to accuracy consideration and the amount of calculations proportional to the number of spatial grid points. Performed numerical experiments show good computational performance of the algorithm and accuracy of forecasting meteorological fields. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Agent technology is a new approach of Distributed Artificial Intelligence to implement autonomous entities driven by beliefs, goals, capabilities and plans, and other agency properties such as adaptation, interaction, and mobility. Software agents are the focus of considerable research in the artificial intelligence community, but not much has been done in the field of software engineering. In this paper, we present an object-oriented framework for building software agents in a distributed environment. The design of the framework also allows an easy mapping of the models developed in the analysis and design phase of the Gaia Methodology to object-oriented code. We believe that object-oriented framework technology can reduce not only the development time but also the complexity of implementing multi-agent systems. We present an instantiated application that uses this framework to illustrate an implementation.

AB  - This work presents the idea and a prototype of workflow systems defined through constraints. We think that in many domain areas, such as health care, workflow systems are too inflexible. One does not know in advance what activities does the patient has to go through. Actually a new form of interaction with the workflow is needed, in which a controller asks the systems which precondition activities are necessary in order to execute a target activity and schedule the target activity. We also present Tucupi, a prototype of such constraint based WFMS. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Automatic learning techniques stand as promising tools to respond to the need of higher efficiency of traffic network, even more so at times of mounting pressure from economic and energy markets. To this end, this paper looks into the operation of a traffic network with distributed, intelligent agents. In particular, it casts the task of operating a traffic network as a distributed, stochastic game in which the agents solve reinforcement-learning problems. Results from computational experiments show that these agents can yield substantial gains with respect to the performance achieved by two other control policies for traffic lights. The paper ends with an outline of future research to deploy machine-learning technology in real-world traffic networks. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the current state of fuzzy logic theory in epidemioloy, which is a recent area of research. We present four applications of fuzzy logic theory in epidemic problems, using linguistic fuzzy models, possibility measure, probability of fuzzy events and fuzzy decision making techniques. The results demonstrate that the applications of fuzzy sets in epidemiology is a very promising area of research. The final discussion sets the future stage of fuzzy sets application in epidemiology. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, a refinement calculus called ZRC has been proposed for Z; it follows the style and conventions of the Z notation and is completely formalised. As any other formal technique, however, it needs tool support to be of practical use. In this paper, we present such a tool, which we call ZRC-Refine. It is an interactive tool, whose design makes it distinctively user-friendly. We believe that ZRC-Refine is a significant encouragement to the extended application of ZRC and of Z itself. © Springer-Verlag 2003.

AB  - There are several ways for an intruder to obtain access to a remote computing system, such as exploiting program vulnerabilities, stealing passwords, and so. The intruder can modify system utilities in order to hide his/her presence and to guarantee an open backdoor to the system. Many techniques have been proposed to detect unauthorized file modifications, but they usually work off-line and thus detect file modifications only when the system is already compromised. This paper presents an architecture to deal with this kind of problem. Through the combined use of digital signature techniques and system call interceptions, it allows for transparent on-the-fly integrity check of files in Unix systems. Its evaluation in real-world situations validates the approach, by showing overheads under 10% for most situations. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - This paper outlines the activities and objectives of process and process control audits, aiming at the implementation of advanced process control systems (ACSs) on existing mineral processing plants. Advanced process control systems - also referred to as online optimizing process control systems (OOPCSs) - is a relatively new technology that has been successfully applied to mineral processing plants worldwide with the aim of improving product quality; increasing throughput and recoveries; and reducing power consumption, variability, reagent consumption and operating costs in general. After a brief review of the concepts supporting advanced process control, the phases of their implementation are presented and the initial process and control audits are positioned therein. A detailed view of these audits, their role and the activities thereof, are then presented.

AB  - Neural oscillation is one of the most extensively investigated topics of artificial neural networks. Scientific approaches to the functionalities of both natural and artificial intelligences are strongly related to mechanisms underlying oscillatory activities. This paper concerns itself with the assumption of the existence of central pattern generators (CPGs), which are the plausible neural architectures with oscillatory capabilities, and presents a discrete and generalized approach to the functionality of locomotor CPGs of legged animals. Based on scheduling by multiple edge reversal (SMER), a primitive and deterministic distributed algorithm, it is shown how oscillatory building block (OBB) modules can be created and, hence, how OBB-based networks can be formulated as asymmetric Hopfield-like neural networks for the generation of complex coordinated rhythmic patterns observed among pairs of biological motor neurons working during different gait patterns. It is also shown that the resulting Hopfield-like network possesses the property of reproducing the whole spectrum of different gaits intrinsic to the target locomotor CPGs. Although the new approach is not restricted to the understanding of the neurolocomotor system of any particular animal, hexapodal and quadrupedal gait patterns are chosen as illustrations given the wide interest expressed by the ongoing research in the area.

AB  - AMPLIA is a multi-agent intelligent learning environment designed to support training of diagnostic reasoning and modelling of domains with complex and uncertain knowledge. AMPLIA focuses on the medical area. It is a system that deals with uncertainty under the Bayesian network approach, where learner-modelling tasks will consist of creating a Bayesian network for a problem the system will present. The construction of a network involves qualitative and quantitative aspects. The qualitative part concerns the network topology, that is, causal relations among the domain variables. After it is ready, the quantitative part is specified. It is composed of the distribution of conditional probability of the variables represented. A negotiation process (managed by an intelligent MediatorAgent) will treat the differences of topology and probability distribution between the model the learner built and the one built-in in the system. That negotiation process occurs between the agents that represent the expert knowledge domain (DomainAgent) and the agent that represents the learner knowledge (LearnerAgent). © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - We propose a kind of Bak-Sneppen dynamics as a general optimization technique to treat magnetic systems. The resulting dynamics shows self-organized criticality with power-law scaling of the spatial and temporal correlations. An alternative method of the extremal optimization (EO) is also analyzed here. We provided a numerical confirmation that, for any possible value of its free parameter τ, the EO dynamics exhibits a non-critical behavior with an infinite spatial range and exponential decay of the avalanches. Using the chiral clock model as our test system, we compare the efficiency of the two dynamics with regard to their abilities to find the system's ground state. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The goal of this study is the neural network modeling of two performance variables of Kraft recovery boilers: production of superheated steam and ratio of the generated steam flow rate to the amount of dry solids feed to the boiler. Several physical and chemical phenomena occur simultaneously in these equipments, which play a fundamental role in the Kraft chemical process for wood pulping. Therefore, it is important to understand all relationships among operational variables involved in combustion, reduction, oxidation, and heat transfer process that take place in the boiler. Neural network technique has been applied in this work due to its non-linear modeling capability, difficulties so far found for complete mathematical description of all phenomena occurring in these equipments, and large amount of interest data available at a Brazilian industrial unit. Due to the predominance of non-linear phenomena in chemical process, the potential for application of neural network methods in simulation and control of industrial chemical process is considerably large. In fact, this branch of artificial intelligence research field has grown as much in academic studies as in applications around the world. As a final output of this study, correlation coefficients (r) have been calculated to determine the efficiency of neural network models in predicting Kraft boiler behavior for the interest variables. This parameter measures the degree of linear association between the model theoretical predictions and those measured experimentally. For steam generation model results, r has been determined to be 0.972 and, for the amount of produced steam per ton of feed dry solids, it is equal to 0.907. These values attest the predictive ability of the neural description and the use of the technique to model the interest variable of recovery Kraft boilers.

AB  - Power system restoration (PSR) has been a subject of study for many years. In recent years, many techniques were proposed to solve the limitations of the predetermined restoration guidelines and procedures used by a majority of system operators to restore a system following the occurrence of a wide area disturbance. This paper discusses limitations encountered in some currently used PSR techniques and a proposed improvement based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). The proposed scheme is tested on a 162-bus transmission system and compared with a breadth-search restoration scheme. The results indicate that the use of ANN in power system restoration is a feasible option that should be considered for real-time applications.

AB  - This work presents a synchronous collaborative graphical editor that implements a proposal of an awareness mechanism of a collaborative artifact evolution. The graphical editor allows real-time, highly interactive collaborative work, using the mask metaphor to help participants in creating new diagram versions without interrupting the interaction as also to provide awareness of the diagram versions created. This paper describes the mask metaphor, the collaborative editor that implements this metaphor and discusses a case study conducted with the use of the tool. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Traditional approaches to ecological modeling, based on mathematical equations, are hampered by the qualitative nature of ecological knowledge. In this article, we demonstrate that qualitative reasoning provides alternative and productive ways for ecologists to develop, organize, and implement models. We present a qualitative theory of population dynamics and use this theory to capture and simulate commonsense theories about population and community ecology. Advantages of this approach include the possibility of deriving relevant conclusions about ecological systems without numeric data; a compositional approach that enables the reusability of models representing partial behavior; the use of a rich vocabulary describing objects, situations, relations, and mechanisms of change; and the capability to provide causal interpretations of system behavior.

AB  - A multi-layer neural network is constructed to describe the thermal decomposition of rhodium acetate. Critical analysis of the residual, trained, interpolated and extrapolated errors, with the number of neurons, indicates the efficiency of the present approach, It was possible, within this framework, to improve the An model, with a better correlation between the results. A new value of the activation energy, Ea, and frequency factor, Z, are calculated for the decomposition process. Since the neural network is more precise than a particular model, the calculated values for these quantities are believed to be more precise. The computed values are Ea=194.0 kJ mol-1 and Z=5.23·1016s-1. The neural network eliminates the step to decide, among the available models, the one that best fit the data. An agreement up to four significant figures can be achieved even for data not used in the training process, both in the interpolated and extrapolated regions. This method suggests, therefore, an important alternative tool for the experimentalists. The present approach can also be adapted to other systems and to data in two dimensions.

AB  - Due to the continuous increase in energy demand, without the corresponding investment in generation and transmission capacity, power systems have been operating close to their limits. Thus, the use of tools for supporting the operation is essential in order to increase reliability, reducing the number and/or duration of non-programmable interruptions, optimizing the use of assets. Aiming to reduce the duration of interruptions, several research works have been published describing tools developed to support the fault diagnosis task. These tools would be used during real time operation, after contingencies with definitive interruptions before starting the restoration process. This paper discusses important aspects of the fault diagnosis problem and the techniques more frequently employed to model and tackle this problem.

AB  - Zipf’s law asserts that in all natural languages the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank. The significance, if any, of this result for language remains a mystery. Here we examine a null hypothesis for the distribution of word frequencies, a so-called discourse-triggered word choice model, which is based on the assumption that the more a word is used, the more likely it is to be used again. We argue that this model is equivalent to the neutral infinite-alleles model of population genetics and so the degeneracy of the different words composing a sample of text is given by the celebrated Ewens sampling formula [Theor. Pop. Biol. 3 87 1972], which we show to produce an exponential distribution of word frequencies. © 2004 The American Physical Society.

AB  - We present an open multiagent architecture for intelligent collaborative information systems based on the concepts of cognitive agents and machine learning. We assume a double hypothesis: (i) agents collaborate to reach their goals; (ii) agents can find and interact with other agents in a network. This assumption implies specialized services that have as functions: (a) relate the needs of user agents with the services of supplier agents; (b) integrate several answers in order to produce better results; (c) send regular notification to user agents about changes in the world. The location of such services depends on the architecture one adopts. We focus on the definition of architecture able to dynamically integrate new agents into the system. Thus, agents shall have machine learning capabilities inherited from a generic agent. An open architecture brings some benefits to the system performance such as adaptability, availability of services, incremental development and improvement of lifetime. System proactive capabilities may extend the knowledge human users have about the process. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In this paper we present a study comparing the performance of different systems found in the literature that perform the task of automatic text segmentation in sentences for English documents. We also show the difficulties found to adapt these systems to make them work with Portuguese documents and the results obtained after the adaptation. We analyzed two systems that use a machine learning approach: MxTerminator and Satz, and a customized system based on fixed rules expressed by Regular Expressions. The results achieved by the Satz system were surprisingly positive for Portuguese documents. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The regression-by-discretization approach allows the use of classification algorithm in a regression task. It works as a pre-processing step in which the numeric target value is discretized into a set of intervals. We had applied this approach to the Hidden Markov Model for Regression (HMMR) which was successfully compared to the Naive Bayes for Regression and two traditional forecasting methods, Box-Jenkins and Winters. In this work, to further improve these results, we apply three discretization methods to HMMR using ten time series data sets. The experimental results showed that one of the discretization methods improved the results in most of the data sets, although each method improved the results in at least one data set. Therefore, it would be better to have a search algorithm to automatically find the optimal number and width of the intervals. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The authors present and demonstrate an efficient method to estimate the bit error rate (BER) of turbo codes via a truncated importance sampling (TIS). The TIS method is based on the relevant code words that effectively contribute to the total BER. In order to find out these code words, a fast algorithm is proposed. Two examples are presented to describe the TIS method. The method is particularly effective at high signal to noise ratio (SNR), where Monte Carlo (MC) simulation takes too much time to obtain an estimative that is statistically sound. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - One of the main problems in using logic for solving problems is the high computational costs involved in inference. In this paper, we propose the use of a notion of relevance in order to cut the search space for a solution. Instead of trying to infer a formula a directly from a large knowledge base K, we consider first only the most relevant sentences in K for the proof. If those are not enough, the set can be increased until, at the worst case, we consider the whole base K. We show how to define a notion of relevance for first-order logic with equality and analyze the results of implementing the method and testing it over more than 700 problems from the TPTP problem library. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In the area of monitoring communication networks, GEDSystem is a tool for supporting the development of programs driven to the management of domains that may show up when networks are monitored by SNMP. This tool is supported by an automatic modeling of data and events and automates the grouping of MIB objects from several SNMP agents, producing data structures that represent Domains and Events. The structures are automatically transformed into Tables and Views of a relational database. The views implement the perception mechanisms of the Events defined in the tool. The GEDSystem also provides a Monitoring Agent that automatically recognizes, collects and stores information about the Domains. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In Data Mining, one of the steps of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, the use of concept hierarchies as a background knowledge allows to express the discovered knowledge in a higher abstraction level, more concise and usually in a more interesting format. However, data mining for high level concepts is more complex because the search space is generally too big. Some data mining systems require the database to be pre-generalized to reduce the space, what makes difficult to discover knowledge at arbitrary levels of abstraction. To efficiently induce high-level rules at different levels of generality, without pre-generalizing databases, fast access to concept hierarchies and fast query evaluation methods are needed. This work presents the NETUNO-HC system that performs induction of classification rules using concept hierarchies for the attributes values of a relational database, without pre-generalizing them or even using another tool to represent the hierarchies. It is showed how the abstraction level of the discovered rules can be affected by the adopted search strategy and by the relevance measures considered during the data mining step. Moreover, it is demonstrated by a series of experiments that the NETUNO-HC system shows efficiency in the data mining process, due to the implementation of the following techniques: (i) a SQL primitive to efficient execute the databases queries using hierarchies; (ii) the construction and encoding of numerical hierarchies; (iii) the use of Beam Search strategy, and (iv) the indexing and encoding of rules in a hash table in order to avoid mining discovered rules. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In the past few years, the multi-agent systems (MAS) area has presented an accelerated growth. New techniques and tools are constantly being proposed and several methodologies have been published to support the development of MAS. Most of these methodologies concentrate on the system analysis phase, giving almost no support for MAS implementation. Since agents can be seen as sort of specialized distributed components, in this paper we propose an agent deployment model based on the CORBA Component Model. We also describe a case study to show the potential of an agent-based application development using this model. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper presents a new, simple and efficient texture classification method using Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm. In the learning stage, LZW algorithm constructs dictionaries for the horizontal and vertical structure of each class. In the classification stage, texture samples to be classified are encoded by LZW in static mode, using the dictionaries constructed in the learning stage, in vertical and horizontal scanning order. A sample is assigned to the class whose dictionaries minimize the average horizontal and vertical coding rate. The classifier was evaluated for various sample sizes and training set sizes, using 30 Brodatz textures. The proposed method correctly classified 100% of 3000 Brodatz texture samples, and direct comparisons indicated the superiority of the method over several high performance classifiers. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - While neural networks have been successfully used in a number of machine learning applications, logical languages have been the standard for the representation of legal and argumentative reasoning. In this paper, we present a new hybrid model of computation that allows for the deduction and learning of argumentative reasoning. We propose a Neural Argumentation Algorithm to translate argumentation networks into standard neural networks, and prove correspondence between the semantics of the two networks. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - In text categorization tasks, the dimensionality reduction become necessary to computation and interpretability of the results generated by machine learning algorithms due to the high-dimensional vector representation of the documents. This paper describes a new feature extraction method called semantic mapping and its application in categorization of web documents. The semantic mapping uses SOM maps to construct variables in reduced space, where each variable describes the behavior of a group of features semantically related. The performance of the semantic mapping is measured and compared empirically with the performance of sparse random mapping and PCA methods and shows to be better than random mapping and a good alternative to PCA. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - Evolutionary Programming (EP) has been used to solve a large variety of problems. This technique uses concepts of Darwin's theory to evolve finite state machines (FSMs). However, most works develop tailor-made EP frameworks to solve specific problems. These frameworks generally require significant modifications in their kernel to be adapted to other domains. To easy reuse and to allow modularity, modular FSMs were introduced. They are fundamental to get more generic EP frameworks. In this paper, we introduce the framework Splinter, capable of evolving modular FSMs. It can be easily configured to solve different problems. We illustrate this by presenting results from the use of Splinter for two problems: the artificial ant problem and the sequence of characters. The results validate the Splinter implementation and show that the modularity benefits do not decrease the performance. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In this paper we describe the learning and reasoning mechanisms of a cognitive model based on the systemic approach and on the autopoiesis theory. These mechanisms assume perception and action capabilities that can be captured through propositional symbols and uses logic for representing environment knowledge. The logical theories are represented by their conjunctive and disjunctive normal forms. These representations are enriched to contain annotations that explicitly store the relationship among the literals and (dual) clauses in both forms. Based on this representation, algorithms are presented that leam a theory from the agent's experiences in the environment and that are able to determine the robustness degree of the theories given an assignment representing the environment state. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper presents a clustering method for interval-valued data using a dynamic cluster algorithm with adaptive squared Euclidean distances. This method furnishes a partition and a prototype to each cluster by optimizing an adequacy criterion that measures the fitting between the clusters and their representatives. To compare a class with its representative, the method uses an adaptive version of a squared Euclidean distance to interval-valued data. Experiments with real and artificial interval-valued data sets shows the usefulness of the this method. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - One of the main objectives of a Machine Learning - ML - system is to induce a classifier that minimizes classification errors. Two relevant topics in ML are the understanding of which domain characteristics and inducer limitations might cause an increase in misclassification. In this sense, this work analyzes two important issues that might influence the performance of ML systems: class imbalance and errorprone small disjuncts. Our main objective is to investigate how these two important aspects are related to each other. Aiming at overcoming both problems we analyzed the behavior of two over-sampling methods we have proposed, namely Smote + Tomek links and Smote + ENN. Our results suggest that these methods are effective for dealing with class imbalance and, in some cases, might help in ruling out some undesirable disjuncts. However, in some cases a simpler method, Random over-sampling, provides compatible results requiring less computational resources. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - A growing need related to the use of knowledge-based systems (KBSs) is that these systems provide ways of adaptive interaction with the user. A comparative analysis of approaches to develop KBSs allowed us to identify a high functional quality level and a lack of integration of human factors in their frameworks. In this article, we propose an approach to develop adaptive and interactive KBSs that integrate works from the Knowledge Engineering and HCI areas, through the definition of a unified software architecture. A contribution of this work is the use of interaction patterns in order to define the interaction flow according to the user profile. These interaction patterns are defined for different kinds of interaction, such as, explanation, cooperation, argumentation or criticism. The reusable architecture components were implemented using Java and Protégé-2000, and they were used in a KBS for assessment of installments of tax debts. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The mission of an organization stands for its goals and also leads corrections likely to occur in the posture adopted by the organization before the society. In order to fulfill the goals of the organization, this one needs to interact with other components of the society. Within an organization each individual responsible for the sale and purchase of either commodities or services detains knowledge concerning possible values of the criteria used to represent a determined commodity or service which may be either offered or accepted in a negotiation. So, an offer may be seen as an inconsistency aroused between the previous knowledge owned by the negotiator and the offer. This article presents a Paraconsistent Approach based on a heuristic of multi-value decrement followed by formalization into Evidential Paraconsistent Logic to assess offers in a negotiation session. When compared to the Utility Value Approach, the paraconsistent one converges toward the negotiation ending with fewer interactions. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper describes a new generic architecture for dialog systems enabling communication between a human user and a personal assistant based on speech acts. Dialog systems are often domain-related applications. That is, the system is developed for specific applications and cannot be reused in other domains. A major problem concerns the development of scalable dialog systems capable to be extended with new tasks without much effort. In this paper we discuss a generic dialog architecture for a personal assistant. The assistant uses explicit task representation and knowledge to achieve an "intelligent" dialog. The independence of the dialog architecture from knowledge and from tasks allows the agent to be extended without needing to modify the dialog structure. The system has been implemented in a collaborative environment in order to personalize services and to facilitate the interaction with collaborative applications like e-mail clients, document managers or design tools. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The scope of this paper is to analyze the main obstacles that resulted in the deployment of an unsuccessful G2G (Government to Government) enterprise in Brazil due to user resistance to Information Systems. In order to achieve this, case study explanatory methodology along with interpretative research based on a recent real-life case was adopted, namely the digital link between the Brazilian Central Bank and the Federal Senate. Some findings are drawn with respect to the importance of adequately managing the change associated with an endeavor such as the one analyzed in order to assist policy makers and public administrators in dealing with this new field of knowledge. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - We describe a refutation-based theorem proving algorithm capable of checking the satisfiability of non-ground formulae modulo (a combination of) theories. The key idea is the use of abstraction to drive the application of (i) ground satisfiability checking modulo theories axiomatized by equational clauses, (ii) Presburger arithmetic, and (iii) quantifier instantiation. A prototype implementation is used to discharge the proof obligations necessary to show the correctness of some typical programs manipulating arrays. On these benchmarks, the prototype automatically discharge more proof obligations than Simplify - the prover of reference for program checking - thereby confirming the viability of our approach. ©Sorineer-Verlae 2004.

AB  - For some B2C or B2B market places, such as electronic shopping malls, agents representing the buyers could "go shopping" and negotiate with several stores looking for the best deal. To develop agents capable to act in a scenario like this one, it is necessary to deal with several issues that go beyond the bilateral negotiation or auction. In the agent mediated e-commerce literature, there are no in-depth studies on this kind of negotiation, which we call sequential bilateral negotiations (SBNs). The related works provide only superficial insights on multiple bilateral negotiations or are rather concerned with auction models. In this paper, we characterize SBNs, showing the differences between them and auctions or simple bilateral negotiations. We also discuss the main issues on defining a negotiation protocol and designing agents for SBN. In order to achieve a better understanding on SBN and its practical implications, we present a particular implementation of a SBN protocol and an ensemble of agents capable of carrying negotiations under this protocol. This implementation provides experimental results illustrating some nuances of this kind of negotiation model. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - One of the major difficulties to finding accurate mobile terminal location is the lack of line-of-sight propagation (NLOS) caused by blocking of the signal's direct path by obstacles. A tracking approach based on the Kalman recursive filtering of time-of-arrival (TOA) measurement has been successfully employed to mitigate NLOS error, but it strongly depends on proper identification of NLOS/LOS states. In this paper we propose a composite hypothesis testing to detect LOS⇄NLOS transitions. The decision thresholds are set to minimize false alarm and miss probabilities considering statistical parameters of the location scenario. Restricted assumptions such as uncorrelation of TOA measurements (when NLOS corrupted) and knowledge of NLOS error statistics are not required. Simulation results show the validity of the proposal when compared with the technique of identifying NLOS/LOS states by standard deviation computation. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology for automatic selection of software and hardware IP components for embedded applications. Design space exploration is achieved by the correct selection of a SW-IP block to be executed in a platform containing different implementations of the same ISA. These different versions of the same ISA dissipate a different amount of power and require a different number of cycles to execute the same program. This way, by making the software execute on a different processor to achieve the required power or energy of an application, one can fine tune the platform for the desired market. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - Despite neglected by most security managers due to the low availability of tools, the content analysis of firewall logs is fundamental (a) to measure and identify accesses to external and private networks, (b) to access the historical growth of accesses volume and applications used, (c) to debug problems on the configuration of filtering rules and (d) to recognize suspicious event sequences that indicate strategies used by intruders in attempt to obtain non-authorized access to stations and services. This paper presents an approach to classify, characterize and analyze events generated by firewalls. The proposed approach explores the case-based reasoning technique, from the Artificial Intelligence field, to identify possible intrusion scenarios. The paper also describes the validation of our approach carried out based on real logs generated along one week by the university firewall. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2004.

AB  - Database administration routines involve manual or semi-automatic methods for monitoring the environment and solving problems that arise. In this work, we propose a novel alternative approach to this task, which unifies two Artificial Intelligence techniques: Case Based Reasoning and Intelligent Agents. Our prototype, DBSitter, consists of a Multi-agent system for automatic monitoring and fault correcting in a relational DBMS, where problems are represented as Cases. In searching for better solutions, the system can also interact with the Database Administrator. The main functionalities provided are failure prediction and adaptation of problem-solving capabilities through the chosen learning mechanism. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - Enterprise delegates Agents' Negotiation is a simpler task if the enterprises involved in the transaction have homogeneous representation structures as well as the same domain of discourse, thus the use of a common ontology eases semantic problems. However, in real-life situations, real problems involve heterogeneity and different ontologies often developed by several persons and tools. Moreover, domain evolution, or changes in the conceptualisation might cause modifications on the previous ontologies once there is no formal mapping between high-level ontologies. We are proposing a method to be used by an Ontology-Services Agent to make Agents to understand each other despite their different ontologies. The method uses the natural language description of each involved item/product/service and combining statistical, clustering and suffix stripping algorithms finds out similarities between different concepts represented in different ontologies. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The management of computing grids is required in order to allow the proper operation of the grid services offered to users. However, the management of the underlying network infrastructure, which supports the grid communications, is proceeded through different management systems than those used for the grid management. In this scenario, an integrated management of grids and networks could turn the maintenance processes easier. This paper proposes an hierarchical policy-based architecture whose goal is to allow such desired integration. In the architecture proposed grid policies are translated to network policies following mapping rules defined by network administrators. The paper also describes a prototype implemented based on the architecture. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Understanding how students learn chemical concepts has been a great concern for researchers of chemical education, who want to identify the most important misunderstandings and develop strategies to overcome conceptual problems. Qualitative Reasoning has great potential for building conceptual models that can be useful for chemical education. This paper describes a qualitative model for supporting understanding the interaction between chemical reactions and electric current in the Daniell cell. We discuss the potential of the model for science education of deaf students. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - A Genetic Algorithm based learning procedure was proposed earlier by the authors and the results, advantages and usefulness of the proposal have been reported in the literature. The procedure is based on the Pittsburgh approach and is divided in two separate phases: learning of candidate rules and selection of relevant rules. The learning and the optimization processes involve an evaluation function that considers the performance of the candidate rule base, requiring the selection and use of a particular reasoning method. With the objective of investigating further the robustness and usefulness of the previous approach, the authors developed a comparative study of the GA learning algorithm focusing on the impact of the reasoning method used. Two different methods were used: the one based on a single winner rule, and the one based on the combination of all rules. Following the description of the rules format and reasoning methods used, the GA learning and optimization approach proposed before is also reviewed. The comparison of simulation results is presented based on the criteria of correct classification rates and number of rules in the rule base. The results demonstrate that the knowledge base performance is similar in both cases, suggesting that the GA learning procedure derives good rule bases despite the reasoning method used. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Patrolling is a complex multi-agent task, which usually requires agents to coordinate their decision-making in order to achieve optimal performance of the group as a whole. In previous work, many patrolling strategies were developed, based on different approaches: heuristic agents, negotiation mechanisms, reinforcement learning techniques, techniques based on graph-theory and others. In this paper, we complement these studies by comparing all the approaches developed so far for this domain, using patrolling problem instances that were not dealt with before (i.e. new map topologies). The final results constitute a valuable benchmark for this domain, as well as a survey of the strategies developed so far for this task. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

This article outlines a conceptual model and the accompanying research challenges for providing easy legal and technological mechanisms by which any creator might affirmatively and permanently mark and make accessible a geographic dataset such that the world knows where the dataset came from and that the data is available for use without the law assuming that the user must first acquire permission. © Springer-Verlag; 2004.

AB  - Many researchers on Intelligent Learning Environments have proposed the use of Artificial Intelligence through architectures based on agents' societies. Teaching systems based on Multi-Agent architectures make possible to support the development of more interactive and adaptable systems. At the same time many people have been working to produce metadata specification towards a construction of Learning Objects in order to improve efficiency efficacy and reusability of learning content based on Object Oriented design paradigm. This paper proposes an agent based approach to produce more intelligent learning objects according to FIPA agent architecture reference model and LOM/IEEE 1484 learning object specification learning objects. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - A hybrid system WELS implemented with the combination of Fractal Dimension Theory and Fuzzy Approximate Reasoning, in order to analyze datasets. In this paper, we describe its application in the initial phase of clustering methodology: the clustering tendency analysis. The Box-Counting Algorithm is carried out on a dataset, and with its resultant curve one obtains numeric indications related to the features of the dataset. Then, a fuzzy inference system acts upon these indications and produces information which enable the analysis mentioned above. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper presents an overview of current work on the recognition of sign language and a prototype of a simple editor for a small subset of the Brazilian Sign Language, LIBRAS. Handshape based alphabetical signs, are captured by a single digital camera, processed on-line by using computational vision techniques and converted to the corresponding Latin letter. The development of such prototype employed a machine-learning technique, based on automata theory and adaptive devices. This technique represents a new approach to be used in the far more complex problem of full LIBRAS recognition. As it happens with spoken languages, sign languages are not universal. They vary a lot from country to country, and in spite of the existence of many works in American Sign Language (ASL), the automatic recognition of Brazilian Sign Language has not been extensively studied. ... © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - A particular challenge in the domain of student diagnosis concerns how to 'recognize' and 'remediate' student errors. Machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to identify categories of errors and then to discriminate a new error in order to provide feedback to the student. However, remediation very often requires interpreting student errors in terms of knowledge in the context of a specific learning situation. This work is mainly concerned with this problem area. In this sense, we present here an approach to student diagnosis founded on a cognitive framework, called Conception Model, developed in the domain of educational research. The main issue about the Conception Model is the fact that it allows representing student errors in terms of knowledge applied to a learning context. We describe the main aspects of the student diagnosis system we have implemented, and then we evaluate the diagnosis results by comparing them to human diagnoses. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper presents an automatic critiquer of Computer Science Abstracts in Portuguese, which formulates critiques and/or suggestions of improvement based on automatic argumentative structure recognition. The recognition is performed by an statistical classifier, similar to Teufel and Moens's Argumentative Zoning (AZ) [1], but ported to work on Portuguese abstracts. The critiques and suggestions made by the system come from a set of fixed critiquing rules based on corpus observations and guidelines for good writing from the literature. Here we describe the overall system and report on the AZ porting exercise, its intrinsic evaluation and application in the critiquer. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Joining, through Internet, geographically distributed dedicated heterogeneous clusters of workstations can be an inexpensive approach to achieve data-intensive computation. This paper describes a master/worker based system architecture and the strategies used to obtain effective collaboration in such a collection of clusters. Based on this architecture an analytical model was built to predict and tune applications' execution performance and behaviour over time This architecture and model were employed for the matrix multiplication algorithm over two heterogeneous clusters, one in Brazil and the other in Spain. Our approach results show that the model reaches 94% prediction, achieving 91% of the clusters' total performance. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper presents a novel Intelligent Tutoring System based on traditional and connectionist Artificial Intelligence. It is adaptive and reactive and has the ability to offer customized and dynamic teaching. Features of apprentice's psychological profile or learning style are employed as basic elements of customization, and they are complemented by (human) expert rules. These rules are represented by probability distributions. The proposed system is implemented on web environment to take advantages such as wide reach and portability. Three types of navigation (on course contents) are compared based on user performances: free (user has full control), random (user is controlled by chance) and intelligent (navigation is controlled by the proposed system: neural network combined with expert rules). Descriptive and inferential analysis of data indicate that the application of proposed techniques is adequate, based on (significant at 5%) results. The main aspects that have been studied are retention ("learning improvement") normalized gain, navigation total user time and number of steps (length of visited content). Both customizations (by psychological profiles and learning styles) have shown good results and no significant difference has been found between them. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - We examine modal logical systems, with generalized operators, for the precise treatment of vague notions such as 'often', 'a meaningful subset of a whole', 'most', 'generally' etc. The intuition of 'most' as "all but for a 'negligible' set of exceptions" is made precise by means of filters. We examine a modal logic, with a new modality for a local version of 'most' and present a sound and complete axiom system. We also discuss some variants of this modal logic. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper presents DiZer, an automatic Discourse analyZER for Brazilian Portuguese. Given a source text, the system automatically produces its corresponding rhetorical analysis, following Rhetorical Structure Theory - RST [1]. A rhetorical repository, which is DiZer main component, makes the automatic analysis possible. This repository, produced by means of a corpus analysis, includes discourse analysis patterns that focus on knowledge about discourse markers, indicative phrases and words usages. When applicable, potential rhetorical relations are indicated. A preliminary evaluation of the system is also presented. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The new network management scenario has larger and more complex infrastructures to manage and requires more elaborated applications to cope with its inherent complexity. Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is a possible technology solution for the scalability problems presented by the traditional server-centric applications. However, the implementation of distributed architectures is a complex task and carries problems by its own. In this paper, we will present the current results from our researches on the application of two of most innovative distributed system architectures for network management system: grids of agents and mobile agents. The experiments argument in favor of using DAI for network management system and provide architectural and performance reference for future developments. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - It is well known that traditional quantifiers ∀ and ∃ are not suitable for expressing common sense rules such as 'birds fly.' This sentence expresses the defeasible idea that 'most birds fly,' and not 'all birds fly.' Another defeasible rule is exemplified by 'many Americans like American football.' Noun phrases such as 'most birds, many birds,' or even 'some birds' are recognized by semanticists as natural language generalized quantifiers. From a non-monotonic reasoning perspective, one can divide the class of linguistic generalized quantifiers into two categories. The first partition includes categorical quantifiers such as 'all birds.' The other one includes the defeasible quantifiers such as 'most birds' and 'many birds.' It is clear that the semantics of defeasible quantifiers leaves room for exceptions. The exceptional elements licensed by defeasible generalized quantifiers are usually the 'non flying birds' that non-monotonic logics deal with. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This work is part of the Multicheck1 Project that defines architecture of cognitive and independent agents for the automatic treatment of Brazilian handwritten bank checks. The concept of autonomous agents allows us to organize the application knowledge and brings several benefits to the approach. A triple hypothesis supports this approach. First, the nature of the problem in question allows decomposition in well-defined tasks, and each of them can be encapsulated in an independent agent. Second, the natural capability of interaction of the agents makes the check treatment process more robust, solving situations apparently difficult. Third, the natural parallelism between the agents can contribute to implement an application with high performance. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This article describes a technique that aims at qualifying a concept hierarchy with colors, in such a way that it can be feasible to promote the interactivity between the user and an incremental probabilistic concept formation algorithm. The main idea behind this technique is to use colors to map the concept properties being generated, to combine them, and to provide a resulting color that will represent a specific concept. The intention is to assign similar colors to similar concepts, thereby making it possible for the user to interact with the algorithm and to intervene in the concept formation process by identifying which approximate concepts are being separately formed. An operator for interactive merge has been used to allow the user to combine concepts he/she considers similar. Preliminary evaluation on concepts generated after interaction has demonstrated improved accuracy. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The number of ontologies publicly available and accessible through the web has increased in the last years, so that the task of rinding similar terms 1 among these structures becomes mandatory. We depict the application and the evaluation of a new similarity measure for comparing Portuguese Ontological Structures (OSs) called Lexical Similarity (LS). This paper describes contributions to the study and application of mapping between terms present in multidomain OSs. In order to approach this mapping we combine preliminar similarity measures and heuristics. Our measure uses a stemmer, it is established upon String Matching (SM) proposed in [1] and it was evaluated by means of a comparison to human evaluation. Finally, we concentrate on the application of LS measure to terms belonging to same domain thesauri and discuss the results obtained. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - JBoss is an extensible Java application server that affords remote access to EJB components via multiple protocols. Its IIOP module supports IIOP-enabled EJBs, which are accessible both to RMI/IIOP clients written in Java and to CORBA clients written in various languages. While other systems use compilation-based approaches to generate IIOP stubs and skeletons, JBoss employs reflective techniques to avoid extra compilation steps and support on-the-fly deployment. CORBA/IIOP is a dynamic feature of JBoss in two senses: (i) the IIOP module can be dynamically deployed into a running server, and (ii) IIOP-enabled EJBs are dynamically deployable components themselves. This paper presents the design of the IIOP module and describes the actions that module takes at EJB deployment time, including the creation of POAs, the instantiation of CORBA servants to implement IDL interfaces not known in advance, and the dynamic generation of IIOP stub classes made available to Java clients via HTTP. © Springer-Verlags 2004.

AB  - Automatic Summarization (AS) in Brazil has only recently become a significant research topic. When compared to other languages initiatives, such a delay can be explained by the lack of specific resources, such as expressive lexicons and corpora that could provide adequate foundations for deep or shallow approaches on AS. Taking advantage of having commonalities with respect to resources and a corpus of texts and summaries written in Brazilian Portuguese, two NLP research groups have decided to start a common task to assess and compare their AS systems. In the experiment five distinct extractive AS systems have been assessed. Some of them incorporate techniques that have been already used to summarize texts in English; others propose novel approaches to AS. Two baseline systems have also been considered. An overall performance comparison has been carried out, and its outcomes are discussed in this paper. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - A regular and demanding task in legal offices is the search for documents upon an arbitrary subject. The point lies in the fact that each new process is analysed according to similar ocurrent ones which have already - occurred the past analyses support the current one. Nevertheless, this search is time-consuming since the number of documents is generally large. Classical IR tools usually retrieve a significative amount of irrelevant documents - where the terms of the query do not express the meaning intended - and may miss relevant ones - where the meaning intended is represented by different terms. In this paper, a search engine based on Conceptual Analysis is presented. The search engine enables the retrieval of documents based on the meaning expressed by the terms of a query rather than on their lexical representation. Therefore, it attains a more effective analysis of past processes in legal offices. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper presents a neural-evolutionary framework for the simulation of market models in a bounded rationality scenario. Each agent involved in the scenario make use of a population of neural networks in order to make a decision, while inductive learning is performed by means of an evolutionary algorithm. We show that good convergence to the game-theoretic equilibrium is reached within certain parameters. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - A challenge in hybrid evolutionary algorithms is to define efficient strategies to cover all search space, applying local search only in actually promising search areas. This paper proposes a way of detecting promising search areas based on clustering. In this approach, an iterative clustering works simultaneously to an evolutionary algorithm accounting the activity (selections or updatings) in search areas and identifying which of them deserves a special interest. The search strategy becomes more aggressive in such detected areas by applying local search. A first application to unconstrained numerical optimization is developed, showing the competitiveness of the method. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper presents results of the Hurst parameter for digital signature of network segments. It's also presented a model for digital signature automatic generation which aims at the characterization of traffic in network segments. The use of the digital signature allows the manager to: identify limitations and crucial points of the network; establish the real use of network resources; better control the use of resources and the establishment of thresholds for the generation of more accurate and intelligent alarms which suit the real network characteristics. The obtained results validate the experiment and show in practice significant advantages in networks management. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Ecolingua is an ontology for ecological quantitative data, which has been designed through reuse of a conceptualisation of quantities and their physical dimensions provided by the EngMath family of ontologies. A hierarchy of ecological quantity classes is presented together with their definition axioms in first-order logic. An implementation-level application of the ontology is discussed, where conceptual ecological models can be synthesised from data descriptions in Ecolingua through reuse of existing model structures. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Support Vector Machines constitute a powerful Machine Learning technique originally proposed for the solution of 2-class problems. In the multiclass context, many works divide the whole problem in multiple binary subtasks, whose results are then combined. Following this approach, one efficient strategy employs a Directed Acyclic Graph in the combination of pairwise predictors in the multiclass solution. However, its generalization depends on the graph formation, that is, on its sequence of nodes. This paper introduces the use of Genetic Algorithms in intelligently searching permutations of nodes in a DAG. The technique proposed is especially useful in problems with relatively high number of classes, where the investigation of all possible combinations would be extremely costly or even impossible. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In this paper, the notion of degree of inconsistency is introduced as a tool to evaluate the sensitivity of the Full Bayesian Significance Test (FBST) value of evidence with respect to changes in the prior or reference density. For that, both the definition of the FBST, a possibilistic approach to hypothesis testing based on Bayesian probability procedures, and the use of bilattice structures, as introduced by Ginsberg and Fitting, in paraconsistent logics, are reviewed. The computational and theoretical advantages of using the proposed degree of inconsistency based sensitivity evaluation as an alternative to traditional statistical power analysis is also discussed. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Reorganisation within a multi-agent system may be managed by the agents themselves by adapting the organisation to both environmental changes and their own goals. In this paper, we propose an organisation-centred model for controlling this process. Using the MOISE+ organisation model,we are able to define an organisational structure bearing on a reorganisation process along four phases: monitoring (when to reorganise), design (ways of building a new organisation), selection (how to choose an organisation), and implementation (how to change the current running organisation). The proposed reorganisation scheme is evaluated in the robot soccer domain where we have developed players that follow the team organisation specified in MOISE+. A special group of agents may change this organisation, and thus the team behaviour, using reinforcement learning for the selection phase. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In this paper, we present a proposal for the articulation of collaborative activities based on communication and coordination representation models. Articulation is essential in any kind of collaboration and involves prearticulation of the tasks, their management, and post-articulation. For the representation of pre- and post-articulation phases, conversation clichés (communication) are used. For the coordination phase, a model separating the tasks and their interdependencies is used. The articulation schema, which is especially suited to e-business applications, is then applied to a business-web example. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The delegation of decision making to distributed control agents has been a standard approach to operating large, complex systems. The performance of these multi-agent systems depends as much on the decomposition of the overall operating task as on the interplay between the agents. To that end, game theory has served as a formalism to model multi-agent systems, understand the innerworking of their agents, and analyze issues of convergence (stability) and location of attractors (optimality). This paper delivers simple transformations and algorithms that allow altruistic agents to induce convergence to Nash equilibrium points, and draw these attractors closer to the set of Pareto efficient solutions, of dynamic games whose agents' problems cannot be anticipated. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This is a project on Artificial Life where we simulate an ecosystem that allows cooperative interaction between agents, including intra-specific predator-warning communication in a virtual environment of predatory events. We propose, based on Peircean semiotics and informed by neuroethological constraints, an experiment to simulate the emergence of symbolic communication among artificial creatures. Here we describe the simulation environment and the creatures' control architectures, and briefly present obtained results. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to study a family of logics that approximates classical inference, in which every step in the approximation can be decided in polynomial time. For clausal logic, this task has been shown to be possible by Dalal [4,5]. However, Dalal's approach cannot be applied to full classical logic. In this paper we provide a family of logics, called Limited Bivaluation Logics, via a semantic approach to approximation that applies to full classical logic. Two approximation families are built on it. One is parametric and can be used in a depth-first approximation of classical logic. The other follows Dalal's spirit, and with a different technique we show that it performs at least as well as Dalal's polynomial approach over clausal logic. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Decisions are frequently sent to implementers without much detail. It should not be a surprise, then, that results are not as expected. The lack of accompanying information and a common context produces wrongly implemented or lost decisions. This paper proposes a solution to this problem based on computer technology. In particular, a combination of tools including shared workspaces, process modeling with workflow and a discussion tool, is proposed. A case is used to illustrate the problem and its solution. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The general purpose of this paper is to show a practical instance of how philosophy can benefit from some ideas, methods and techniques developed in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It has to do with some recent claims [4] that some of the most traditional philosophical problems have been raised and, in some sense, solved by AI researchers. The philosophical problem we will deal with here is the representation of non-deductive intra-theoretic scientific inferences. We start by showing the flaws with the most traditional solution for this problem found in philosophy: Hempel's Inductive-Statistical (I-S) model [5J. After we present a new formal model based on previous works motivated by reasoning needs in Artificial Intelligence [11] and show that since it does not suffer from the problems identified in the I-S model, it has great chances to be successful in the task of satisfactorily representing the non-deductive intra-theoretic scientific inferences. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Artificial immune systems (AIS) are adaptive systems developed by taking inspiration from theoretical and experimental immunology and targeted at solving complex problems. Theoretical models are basically aimed at aiding and providing a more qualitative and quantitative description of the biological system they model, sometimes allowing the prediction and design of experiments, and the recovery of information from experimental set-ups. This paper describes the dynamics of one artificial immune network model based on artificial immune systems, named aiNet, and demonstrates through empirical results that even these highly simplified models may present several qualitative behaviours typical of the biological systems and theoretical models; thus being worthy of attention by the more theoretical community. In particular, clonal selection and expansion, affinity maturation, primary, secondary and cross-reactive responses are studied, and demonstrated to be observable in aiNet. Immune network features, such as self-organization, dynamics, connectivity and metadynamics are also discussed.

AB  - The paper investigates temporal properties that are invariant with respect to the temporal ordering and that are expressible by temporal query languages either explicit like FO(≤) or implicit like TL. In the case of an explicit time representation, these 'order invariant' temporal properties are simply those expressible in the language FO(=). In the case of an implicit time representation, we introduce a new language, TL(Ei) that captures exactly these properties. The expressive power of the language TL(Ei) is characterized via a game à la Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé. This provides another proof, using a more classical technique, that the implicit temporal language TL is strictly less expressive than the explicit temporal language FO(≤). This alternative proof is interesting by itself and opens new perspectives in the investigation of results of the same kind for more expressive implicit temporal languages than TL.

AB  - The image foresting transform (IFT) is a graph-based approach to the design of Image processing operators based on connectivity. It naturally leads to correct and efficient implementations and to a better understanding of how different operators relate to each other. We give here a precise definition of the IFT, and a procedure to compute it - a generalization of Dljkstra's algorithm - with a proof of correctness. We also discuss implementation issues and Illustrate the use of the IFT in a few applications.

AB  - This paper proposes a new constrained-syntax genetic programming (GP) algorithm for discovering classification rules in medical data sets. The proposed GP contains several syntactic constraints to be enforced by the system using a disjunctive normal form representation, so that individuals represent valid rule sets that are easy to interpret. The GP is compared with C4.5, a well-known decision-tree-building algorithm, and with another GP that uses Boolean inputs (BGP), in five medical data sets: chest pain, Ljubljana breast cancer, dermatology, Wisconsin breast cancer, and pediatric adrenocortical tumor. For this last data set a new preprocessing step was devised for survival prediction. Computational experiments show that, overall, the GP algorithm obtained good results with respect to predictive accuracy and rule comprehensibility, by comparison with C4.5 and BGP. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is pointed out that the so called momentum method, much used in the neural network literature as an acceleration of the backpropagation method, is a stationary version of the conjugate gradient method. Connections with the continuous optimization method known as heavy ball with friction are also made. In both cases, adaptive (dynamic) choices of the so called learning rate and momentum parameters are obtained using a control Liapunov function analysis of the system. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The pectoral muscle represents a predominant density region in most medio-lateral oblique (MLO) views of mammograms; its inclusion can affect the results of intensity-based image processing methods or bias procedures in the detection of breast cancer. Local analysis of the pectoral muscle may be used to identify the presence of abnormal axillary lymph nodes, which may be the only manifestation of occult breast carcinoma. We propose a new method for the identification of the pectoral muscle in MLO mammograms based upon a multiresolution technique using Gabor wavelets. This new method overcomes the limitation of the straight-line representation considered in our initial investigation using the Hough transform. The method starts by convolving a group of Gabor filters, specially designed for enhancing the pectoral muscle edge, with the region of interest containing the pectoral muscle. After computing the magnitude and phase images using a vector-summation procedure, the magnitude value of each pixel is propagated in the direction of the phase. The resulting image is then used to detect the relevant edges. Finally, a post-processing stage is used to find the true pectoral muscle edge. The method was applied to 84 MLO mammograms from the Mini-MIAS (Mammographic Image Analysis Society, London, U.K.) database. Evaluation of the pectoral muscle edge detected in the mammograms was performed based upon the percentage of false-positive (FP) and false-negative (FN) pixels determined by comparison between the numbers of pixels enclosed in the regions delimited by the edges identified by a radiologist and by the proposed method. The average FP and FN rates were, respectively, 0.58% and 5.77%. Furthermore, the results of the Gabor-filter-based method indicated low Hausdorff distances with, respect to the hand-drawn pectoral muscle edges, with the mean and standard deviation being 3.84±1.73mm over 84 images.

AB  - This paper investigates the creation of efficiency measurements structures of decision-making units (DMUs) called Neuro-DEA, by using high-speed optimization modules called Neuro-LP, inspired in the "philosophy" of an unconventional artificial neural network (ANN) and numerical methods. In addition, the linear programming problem LPP is transformed into an optimization problem without constraints by using a pseudo-cost function, where's added a term of penalty, causing high cost all time that one of the constraints goes violated. The problem is converted into a differential equations system. An unconventional ANN implements a numerical solution based gradient method. © INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING.

AB  - This paper proposes a probabilistic model to optimize the reallocation of transformers with inadequate electrical loading in secondary circuits of distribution systems. The proposed probabilistic model is also compared to one deterministic model. The proposed model, based on the genetic algorithm technique, produces equivalent results to the deterministic model, but offers the advantage of being able to offer various solutions very close to the best global solution to the problem. This range of alternatives offers flexibility to the distribution system planner when choosing the solution to be adopted. In this sense, only micro-economics optimization criteria were considered.

AB  - Mobile robots rely on sensor data to build a representation of their environment. However, sensors usually provide incomplete, inconsistent or inaccurate information. Sensor fusion has been successfully employed to enhance the accuracy of sensor measures. This work proposes and investigates the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques for sensor fusion. Its main goal is to improve the accuracy and reliability of the distance measure between a robot and an object in its work environment, based on measures obtained from different sensors. Several Machine Learning algorithms are investigated to fuse the sensors data. The best model generated by each algorithm is called estimator. It is shown that the employment of estimators based on Artificial Intelligence can improve significantly the performance achieved by each sensor alone. The Machine Learning algorithms employed have different characteristics, causing the estimators to have different behaviors in different situations. Aiming to achieve an even more accurate and reliable behavior, the estimators are combined in committees. The results obtained suggest that this combination can further improve the reliability and accuracy of the distances measured by the individual sensors and estimators used for sensor fusion.

AB  - When rendering images from photographs, acquiring and registering data is a challenge. A solution to this problem is provided by an image-rendering approach that involves three steps. First, a depth map is computed for every input image. Second, the uncertainty information is calculated using the estimated depth maps as starting points. Finally, actual rendering, which renders the uncertainty estimated in the previous step as ellipsoidal Gaussian plots, is performed.

AB  - This paper presents a new, accurate, and efficient technique to increase the spatial resolution of binary halftone images. It makes use of a machine learning process to automatically design a zoom operator starting from pairs of input-output sample images. To accurately zoom a halftone image, a large window and large sample images are required. Unfortunately, in this case, the execution time required by most of the previous techniques may be prohibitive. The new solution overcomes this difficulty by using decision tree (DT) learning. Original DT learning is modified to obtain a more efficient technique (WZDT learning). It is useful to know, a priori, sample complexity (the number of training samples needed to obtain, with probability 1 - δ, an operator with accuracy ε): we use the probably approximately correct (PAC) learning theory to compute the sample complexity. Since the PAC theory usually yields an overestimated sample complexity, statistical estimation is used to evaluate, a posteriori, a tight error bound. Statistical estimation is also used to choose an appropriate window and to show that DT learning has good inductive bias. The new technique is more accurate than a zooming method based on simple inverse halftoning techniques. The quality of the proposed solution is very close to the theoretical optimal obtainable quality for a neighborhood-based zooming process using the Hamming distance to quantify the error. © 2004 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a case study on the use of features derived from remote sensing data for mapping the highly fragmented semideciduous Atlantic forest in Brazil. Innovative aspects of this research include the evaluation of different feature sets in order to improve land cover mapping. The feature sets were defined based on expert knowledge and on data mining techniques to be input to traditional and machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, viz. maximum likelihood, univariate decision trees, multivariate decision trees, and neural networks. The results showed that the maximum likelihood classification using temporal texture descriptors as extracted with wavelet transforms was most accurate to classify the semideciduous Atlantic forest. In this study, a special accuracy measure was used: the so-called class mapping accuracy. Maximum likelihood performed relatively well, with forest mapping accuracies ranging from 34.5 to 51.3%. In contrast, accuracies for neural networks ranged from 19.0 to 45.2%. Classification confusion occurred mainly with coffee and eucalyptus plantations. Univariate trees provided the most robust results for different feature sets, with accuracies ranging from 39.6 to 46.7%. Temporal information of vegetation indices was more important than image texture, terrain topography and raw spectral information for discriminating semideciduous Atlantic forest. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tactic planning or master production scheduling focuses on time and spatial decomposition of the aggregate planning targets and forecasts, as well as, forecast and provision of needed resources. This process becomes extremely hard and time consuming with the increase of number of products, resources and periods considered. In face of such obstacles, this work shows a study of an Artificial Intelligence technique called Simulated Annealing applied to the optimization of production planning problem, more specifically, Master Production Scheduling. This work reviews some of the fundamental theory of simulated annealing, the methodology for master production scheduling calculation, the applicability of simulating annealing to planning problems, most important results and suggestions for further studies.

AB  - Cause-effect analyses is a deterministic methodology intended for processing qualitative(e.g. texts, conventional maps) and mixed, qualitative and quantitative, data. The main idea, employed in cause-effect analysis, is the plurality and interaction of causes. This idea is described by mathematical logic formulae that can be converted into a single Boolean equation. The latter represents a mathematical model of a general shape of cause-effect relations for the study problem. In particular, such a model can express relations between some property of the mineralization and features of other geological phenomena. By processing data, logical dependencies satisfying to the theoretical model are determined in a data file. These dependences, expressed by Boolean function formulae, describe cause-effect relations for a case study, and they are used for predicting. Software realizing the cause-effect analysis is an expert system with artificial intelligence capabilities. There are two methods of using the cause-effect analysis in assessment of mineral resources. The first method consists in detecting the regularity in locations of known mineral deposits and occurrences with the following using the regularity formula for generation of predictive maps. The second method is the evaluation of individual mineral occurrences by obtained Boolean formulae expressing cause-effect relations between deposit sizes and geological environment of deposits. Both methods are illustrated by case studies of predicting gold-bearing deposits of Middle Asia in the former USSR. © 2004 International Association for Mathematical Geology.

AB  - In this work we show how a planner implemented as an abductive reasoning process can have the same performance and behavior as classical planning algorithms. We demonstrate this result by considering three different versions of an abductive event calculus planner on reproducing some important comparative analyses of planning algorithms found in the literature. We argue that a logic-based planner, defined as the application of general purpose theorem proving techniques to a general purpose action formalism, can be a very solid base for the research on extending the classical planning approach. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This work introduces a modified MAX MIN Ant System (MMAS) designed to solve the Capacitated p-Medians Problem (CPMP). It presents the most relevant steps towards the implementation of an MMAS to solve the CPMP, including some improvements on the original MMAS algorithm, such as the use of a density model in the information heuristics and a local search adapted from the uncapacitated p-medians problem. Extensions to a recently proposed updating rule for the pheromone level, aiming at improving the MMAS ability to deal with large-scale instances, are also presented and discussed: Some simulations are performed using instances available from the literature, and well-known heuristics are employed for benchmarking. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - Brazilian educational system is faced with the task of integrating deafs along with non-deafs in the classroom. A requirement of a bilingual education arises, with the Brazilian Sign Language as the native language and Portuguese as the second language. Qualitative Reasoning may provide tools to support Portuguese acquisition while developing scientific concepts. This study describes an experiment with eight deaf students being exposed to three qualitative models. Five students were successful in exploring causal relations and in writing up a composition about an ecological accident. The results encourage us to explore the potential of qualitative models in second language acquisition. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper proposes a new language that can be used to build high-level robot controllers with high-level cognitive functions such as plan specification, plan generation, plan execution, perception, goal formulation, communication and collaboration. The proposed language is based on GoLOG, a language that uses the situation calculus as a formalism to describe actions and deduction as an inference rule to synthesize plans. On the other hand, instead of situation calculus and deduction, the new language uses event calculus and abductive reasoning to synthesize plans. As we can forsee, this change of paradigm allows the agent to reason about partial order plans, making possible a more flexible integration between deliberative and reactive behaviors. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Parallel texts, i.e., texts in one language and their translations to other languages, are very useful nowadays for many applications such as machine translation and multilingual information retrieval. If these texts are aligned in a sentence or lexical level their relevance increases considerably. In this paper we describe some experiments that have being carried out with Brazilian Portuguese and English parallel texts by the use of well known alignment methods: five methods for sentence alignment and two methods for lexical alignment. Some linguistic resources were built for these tasks and they are also described here. The results have shown that sentence alignment methods achieved 85.89% to 100% precision and word alignment methods, 51.84% to 95.61% on corpora from different genres.

AB  - Large-scale applications that require executing very large numbers of tasks are only feasible through parallelism. In this work we present a system that automatically handles large numbers of experiments and data in the context of machine learning. Our system controls all experiments, including re-submission of failed jobs and relies on available resource managers to spawn jobs through pools of machines. Our results show that we can manage a very large number of experiments, using a reasonable amount of idle CPU cycles, with very little user intervention. © Springer-Verlag 2003.

AB  - In recent years, recommender systems have achieved great success. Popular sites give thousands of recommendations every day. However, despite the fact that many activities are carried out in groups, like going to the theater with friends, these systems are focused on recommending items for sole users. This brings out the need of systems capable of performing recommendations for groups of people, a domain that has received little attention in the literature. In this article we introduce a novel method of making collaborative recommendations for groups, based on models built using techniques from symbolic data analysis. After, we empirically evaluate the proposed method to see its behaviour for groups of different sizes and degrees of homogeneity, and compare the achieved results with both an aggregation-based methodology previously proposed and a baseline methodology. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This work presents a partitioning method for clustering symbolic interval-type data using a dynamic cluster algorithm with adaptive Chebyshev distances. This method furnishes a partition and a proto-type for each cluster by optimizing an adequacy criterion that measures the fitting between the clusters and their representatives. To compare interval-type data, the method uses an adaptive Chebyshev distance that changes for each cluster according to its intra-class structure at each iteration of the algorithm. Experiments with real and artificial interval-type data sets demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This work presents a new algorithm, called Heuristically Accelerated Q-Learning (HAQL), that allows the use of heuristics to speed up the well-known Reinforcement Learning algorithm Q-learning. A heuristic function H that influences the choice of the actions characterizes the HAQL algorithm. The heuristic function is strongly associated with the policy: it indicates that an action must be taken instead of another. This work also proposes an automatic method for the extraction of the heuristic function H from the learning process, called Heuristic from Exploration. Finally, experimental results shows that even a very simple heuristic results in a significant enhancement of performance of the reinforcement learning algorithm. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper presents an approach that aims to integrate intelligent agents, user models and automatic content categorization in a virtual environment. In this environment, called AdapTIVE (Adaptive Three-dimensional Intelligent and Virtual Environment), an intelligent virtual agent assists users during navigation and retrieval of relevant information. The users' interests and preferences, represented in a user model, are used in the adaptation of environment structure. An automatic content categorization process, that applies machine-learning techniques, is used in the spatial organization of the contents in the environment. This is a promising approach for new and advanced forms of education, entertainment and e-commerce. In order to validate our approach, a case study of a distance-learning environment, used to make educational content available, is presented. © Springer-Verlag 2004 References.

AB  - In this paper, we study the non lineal temporal series models using ANFIS. We describe its relation with others statistical models and its formulation is included. Later, we analyze a methodological approximation for its initial specification, based on statistical discretion. A case study is included and as a result, we suggest that the methodology can be consider as an step of the non lineal temporal series modelling using ANFIS. © AEPIA.

AB  - Traditional methods for data mining typically make the assumption that the data is centralized, memory-resident, and static. This assumption is no longer tenable. Such methods waste computational and input/output (I/O) resources when data is dynamic, and they impose excessive communication overhead when data is distributed. Efficient implementation of incremental data mining methods is, thus, becoming crucial for ensuring system scalability and facilitating knowledge discovery when data is dynamic and distributed. In this paper, we address this issue in the context of the important task of frequent itemset mining. We first present an efficient algorithm which dynamically maintains the required information even in the presence of data updates without examining the entire dataset. We then show how to parallelize this incremental algorithm. We also propose a distributed asynchronous algorithm, which imposes minimal communication overhead for mining distributed dynamic datasets. Our distributed approach is capable of generating local models (in which each site has a summary of its own database) as well as the global model of frequent itemsets (in which all sites have a summary of the entire database). This ability permits our approach not only to generate frequent itemsets, but also to generate high-contrast frequent itemsets, which allows one to examine how the data is skewed over different sites. © 2004 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a novel range image segmentation method employing an improved robust estimator to iteratively detect and extract distinct planar and quadric surfaces. Our robust estimator extends M-estimator Sample Consensus/Random Sample Consensus (MSAC/RANSAC) to use local surface orientation information, enhancing the accuracy of inlier/outlier classification when processing noisy range data describing multiple structures. An efficient approximation to the true geometric distance between a point and a quadric surface also contributes to effectively reject weak surface hypotheses and avoid the extraction of false surface components. Additionally, a genetic algorithm was specifically designed to accelerate the optimization process of surface extraction, while avoiding premature convergence. We present thorough experimental results with quantitative evaluation against ground truth. The segmentation algorithm was applied to three real range image databases and competes favorably against eleven other segmenters using the most popular evaluation framework in the literature. Our approach lends itself naturally to parallel implementation and application in real-time tasks. The method fits well into several of today's applications in man-made environments, such as target detection and autonomous navigation, for which obstacle detection, but not description or reconstruction, is required. It can also be extended to process point clouds resulting from range image registration. © 2004 IEEE.

AB  - Many people have been working hard to produce metadata specification towards a construction of Learning Objects in order to improve efficiency, efficacy and reusability of learning content based on an Object Oriented design paradigm. The possibility of reusing learning material is very important to designing learning environments for real-life learning. At the same time, many researchers on Intelligent Learning Environments have proposed the use of Artificial Intelligence through architectures based on agent societies. Teaching systems based on Multi-Agent architectures make it possible to support the development of more interactive and adaptable systems. This paper proposes an agent-based approach to produce more intelligent learning objects (ILO) according to the FIPA agent architecture reference model and the LOM/IEEE 1484 learning object specification.

AB  - A system of softwares was developed in order to aid chemical reactor operation and design, as a tool to define operational policies and support process engineers. A C++ software, using artificial intelligence techniques, acts as an Expert System, guiding the user throughout reactor simulation and providing results in an easily comprehensible form. A Fortran software was used to simulate a reactor, including a neural network algorithm to estimate the rate of reactor. The C++ environment works together with the Fortran reactor simulator and a Fortran neural training software. This linked structure is considered part of the "concurrent engineering" study area. As a case study, the Expert System was applied to a fixed bed reactor for ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde, over a Fe-Mo catalyst. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Penicillin G acylase (PGA) is an important enzyme used as biocatalyst in the production of semisynthetic β-lactam antibiotics. Many microorganisms produce this enzyme and recombinant Escherichia coli has been preferred use for industrial applications. Bacillus megaterium is one of the microorganisms that excretes this enzyme into the medium. As a consequence, separation and purification steps are simplified. Online measurement of enzyme activity during cultivation using in-situ sensors is a difficult task in the industrial environment due to the lack of robust and inexpensive instrumentation. This work presents the results of a fuzzy logic algorithm used to determine the moment of maximum enzyme concentration during Bacillus megaterium cultivations in an aerated and stirred, automated lab-scale bioreactor. The fuzzy algorithm was written in Fortran, compiled as a dynamic link library and implemented on a platform developed in MS-Visual Basic. Data were exchanged in real time between the platform and the supervisory system, which was coupled to the bioreactor. It was possible to determine the moment at which maximum enzyme activity was reached in several bioreactor assays. At this point, the end of the process was indicated to the operator. The results illustrate the importance of using reliable computational intelligence-based algorithms in biochemical reactions.

AB  - Inadequate load pickup during power system restoration can lead to overload and underfrequency conditions, and even restart the blackout process, due to thermal energy losses. Thus, load behaviour estimation during restoration is desirable to avoid inadequate pickups. This work describes an artificial intelligence method to aid the operator in taking decisions during system restoration by estimating residential load behaviour parameters such as overload in buses and the necessary time to recover steady-state power consumption. This method uses a fuzzy rule-based system to forecast the residential load, obtaining correct estimates with low computational cost. Test results using actual substation data are presented.

AB  - In this paper, we consider a flexible smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) model with multiple regimes and multiple transition variables. This formulation can be interpreted as a time varying linear model where the coefficients are the outputs of a single hidden layer feedforward neural network. This proposal has the major advantage of nesting several nonlinear models, such as, the self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR), the autoregressive neural network (AR-NN), and the logistic STAR models. Furthermore, if the neural network is interpreted as a nonparametric universal approximation to any Borel measurable function, our formulation is directly comparable to the functional coefficient autoregressive (FAR) and the single-index coefficient regression models. A model building procedure is developed based on statistical inference arguments. A Monte Carlo experiment showed that the procedure works in small samples, and its performance improves, as it should, in medium size samples. Several real examples are also addressed. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - The Intelligent Forecast System (IFS) consists of three units: the main unit is a multilayer neural network; the second unit is based on fuzzy logic, which is used to prepare the data; and the third unit is based on a genetic algorithm and is used to determine the best set of data to be analyzed. The data were set up by using a strategy that classifies the terms of the series into parts with the same quantity of elements. Each part is called a window. The IFS was trained by using a group of windows, which is called a set of training windows. Next, the IFS was applied to solve several problems related to the evaluation of structural integrity. The IFS was applied as an identification strategy and forecast of parameters in a flexible structure. Additionally, by using the IFS we have developed a new strategy to analyze the temporary series obtained from vibrations of flexible structures with the distribution of variable mass. The results obtained in this research, using the IFS applied as an identification strategy and forecast of parameters in a flexible structure, show the effectiveness of the IFS.

AB  - Purpose. Our main goal in this work was to develop an artificial neural network (NN) that could classify specific types of corneal shapes using Zernike coefficients as input. Other authors have implemented successful NN systems in the past and have demonstrated their efficiency using different parameters. Our claim is that, given the increasing popularity of Zernike polynomials among the eye care community, this may be an interesting choice to add complementing value and precision to existing methods. By using a simple and well-documented corneal surface representation scheme, which relies on corneal elevation information, one can generate simple NN input parameters that are independent of curvature definition and that are also efficient. Methods. We have used the Matlab Neural Network Toolbox (MathWorks, Natick, MA) to implement a three-layer feed-forward NN with 15 inputs and 5 outputs. A database from an EyeSys System 2000 (EyeSys Vision, Houston, TX) videokeratograph installed at the Escola Paulista de Medicina-São Paulo was used. This database contained an unknown number of corneal types. From this database, two specialists selected 80 corneas that could be clearly classified into five distinct categories: (1) normal, (2) with-the-rule astigmatism, (3) against-the-rule astigmatism, (4) keratoconus, and (5) post-laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis. The corneal height (SAG) information of the 80 data files was fit with the first 15 Vision Science and it Applications (VSIA) standard Zernike coefficients, which were individually used to feed the 15 neurons of the input layer. The five output neurons were associated with the five typical corneal shapes. A group of 40 cases was randomly selected from the larger group of 80 corneas and used as the training set. Results. The NN responses were statistically analyzed in terms of sensitivity [true positive/(true positive + false negative)], specificity [true negative/(true negative + false positive)], and precision [(true positive + true negative)/total number of cases]. The mean values for these parameters were, respectively, 78.75, 97.81, and 94%. Conclusion. Although we have used a relatively small training and testing set, results presented here should be considered promising. They are certainly an indication of the potential of Zernike polynomials as reliable parameters, at least in the cases presented here, as input data for artificial intelligence automation of the diagnosis process of videokeratography examinations. This technique should facilitate the implementation and add value to the classification methods already available. We also discuss briefly certain special properties of Zernike polynomials that are what we think make them suitable as NN inputs for this type of application.

AB  - Near-infrared Raman spectroscopy (NIRS) is one of the novel techniques that has a potential for in vivo diagnosis of atherosclerosis in human arteries. For such real time clinical applications, a rapid collection and analysis of the data is needed. One of the major problems with the fast data collection is that the noise generated by the detector has the same level as the Raman signal from the tissue, which makes the analysis difficult. In this work, NIRS measurements have been carried out on a total of 60 samples from human coronary arteries. Raman spectral data with the correlated histopathological analysis have been used as a basis to stimulate the cases of severe noise conditions. The main objective of this paper is the comparison of different processing algorithms that have been developed based on either wavelet transformation or principal component analysis for compressing the Raman spectral vectors and a rapid data classification based on different neural network architectures. The developed algorithms found to provide promising diagnosis results with classification errors smaller than 5%, even in the cases of Raman data with collection times as small as 20 ms. It has been concluded that the developed algorithms would be very much useful in the development of Raman spectroscopy systems for in vivo biological applications. © 2004 IPEM.

AB  - The well-known game of chess has traditionally been modeled in artificial intelligence studies by search engines with advanced pruning techniques. The models were thus centered on an inference engine manipulating passive symbols in the form of tokens. It is beyond doubt, however, that human players do not carry out such processes. Instead, chess masters instead carry out perceptual processes, carefully categorizing the chunks perceived in a position and gradually building complex dynamic structures to represent the subtle pressures embedded in the positions. In this paper we will consider two hypotheses concerning the underlying subcognitive processes and architecture. In the first hypothesis, a multiple-leveled chess representational structure is presented, which includes distance graphs (with varying levels of quality) between pieces, piece mobilities, and abstract roles. These representational schemes seem to account for numerous characteristics of human player's psychology. The second hypothesis concerns the extension of the architecture proposed in the Copycat project as central for modeling the emergent intuitive perception of a chess position. We provide a synthesis on how the postulated architecture models chess intuition as an emergent mixture of simultaneous distance estimations, chunk perceptions, abstract role awareness, and intention activations. This is an alternative model to the traditional AI approaches, focusing on the philosophy of active symbols. © Springer 2005.

The author is especially grateful for a series of discussions with Harry Foundalis back in 2000 – which spawned the project in the first place. Harry also undertook an incredibly excruciating proofreading of the manuscript, for which I am deeply indebted. The work has been financed by grants from the CAPES, FAPERJ and FAPESP foundations, and from the PROPESQUISA fund of FGV.

AB  - This paper addresses the range image registration problem for views having low overlap and which may include substantial noise. The current state of the art in range image registration is best represented by the well-known iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm and numerous variations on it. Although this method is effective in many domains, it nevertheless suffers from two key limitations: It requires prealignment of the range surfaces to a reasonable starting point and it is not robust to outliers arising either from noise or low surface overlap. This paper proposes a new approach that avoids these problems. To that end, there are two key, novel contributions in this work: a new, hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) technique, including hillclimbing and parallel-migration, combined with a new, robust evaluation metric based on surface interpenetration. Up to now, interpenetration has been evaluated only qualitatively; we define the first quantitative measure for it. Because they search in a space of transformations, GAs are capable of registering surfaces even when there is low overlap between them and without need for prealignment. The novel GA search algorithm we present offers much faster convergence than prior GA methods, while the new robust evaluation metric ensures more precise alignments, even in the presence of significant noise, than mean squared error or other well-known robust cost functions. The paper presents thorough experimental results to show the improvements realized by these two contributions. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Credit analysts generally assess the risk of credit applications based on their previous experience. They frequently employ quantitative methods to this end. Among the methods used, Artificial Neural Networks have been particularly successful and have been incorporated into several computational tools. However, the design of efficient Artificial Neural Networks is largely affected by the definition of adequate values for their free parameters. This article discusses a new approach to the design of a particular Artificial Neural Networks model, RBF networks, through Genetic Algorithms. It presents an overall view of the problems involved and the different approaches employed to optimize Artificial Neural Networks genetically. For such, several methods proposed in the literature for optimizing RBF networks using Genetic Algorithms are discussed. Finally, the model proposed by the authors is described and experimental results using this model for a credit risk assessment problem are presented. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Harvesting the power of modern graphics hardware to solve the complex problem of real-time rendering of large unstructured meshes is a major research goal in the volume visualization community. While, for regular grids, texture-based techniques are well-suited for current GPUs, the steps necessary for rendering unstructured meshes are not so easily mapped to current hardware. We propose a novel volume rendering technique that simplifies the CPU-based processing and shifts much of the sorting burden to the GPU, where it can be performed more efficiently. Our hardware-assisted visibility sorting algorithm is a hybrid technique that operates in both object-space and Image-space. In object-space, the algorithm performs a partial sort of the 3D primitives In preparation for rasterization. The goal of the partial sort is to create a list of primitives that generate fragments in nearly sorted order. In image-space, the fragment stream is incrementally sorted using a fixed-depth sorting network. In our algorithm, the object-space work is performed by the CPU and the fragment-level sorting is done completely on the CPU. A prototype implementation of the algorithm demonstrates that the fragment-level sorting achieves rendering rates of between one and six million tetrahedral cells per second on an ATI Radeon 9800. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - The authors present a new approach using genetic algorithms, neural networks, and nanorobotics concepts applied to the problem of control design for nanoassembly automation and its application in medicine. As a practical approach to validate the proposed design, we have elaborated and simulated a virtual environment focused on control automation for nanorobotics teams that exhibit collective behavior. This collective behavior is a suitable way to perform a large range of tasks and positional assembly manipulation in a complex three-dimensional workspace. We emphasize the application of such techniques as a feasible approach for the investigation of nanorobotics system design in nanomedicine. Theoretical and practical analyses of control modeling is one important aspect that will enable rapid development in the emerging field of nanotechnology. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel approach for image analysis based on the notion of multiscale connectivity. We use the proposed approach to design several novel tools for object-based image representation and analysis which exploit the connectivity structure of images in a multiscale fashion. More specifically, we propose a nonlinear pyramidal image representation scheme, which decomposes an image at different scales by means of multiscale grain filters. These filters gradually remove connected components from an image that fail to satisfy a given criterion. We also use the concept of multiscale connectivity to design a hierarchical data partitioning tool. We employ this tool to construct another image representation scheme, based on the concept of component trees, which organizes partitions of an image in a hierarchical multiscale fashion. In addition, we propose a geometrically-oriented hierarchical clustering algorithm which generalizes the classical single-linkage algorithm. Finally, we propose two object-based multiscale image summaries, reminiscent of the well-known (morphological) pattern spectrum, which can be useful in image analysis and image understanding applications. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - This paper discusses ongoing research on scientific workflows at the Institute of Computing, University of Campinas (IC - UNICAMP) Brazil. Our projects with bio-scientists have led us to develop a scientific workflow infrastructure named WOODSS. This framework has two main objectives in mind: to help scientists to specify and annotate their models and experiments; and to document collaborative efforts in scientific activities. In both contexts, workflows are annotated and stored in a database. This "annotated scientific workflow" database is treated as a repository of (sometimes incomplete) approaches to solving scientific problems. Thus, it serves two purposes: allows comparison of distinct solutions to a problem, and their designs; and provides reusable and executable building blocks to construct new scientificworkflows, to meet specific needs. Annotations, moreover, allow further insight into methodology, success rates, underlying hypotheses and other issues in experimental activities. The many research challenges faced by us at the moment include: the extension of this framework to the Web, following Semantic Web standards; providing means of discovering workflow components on the Web for reuse; and taking advantage of planning in Artificial Intelligence to support composition mechanisms. This paper describes our efforts in these directions, tested over two domains-agro-environmental planning and bioinformatics.

Once training is completed, global and local normality profiles (NPs) are built from the distribution of quantization errors of the training state vectors and their components, respectively. The global NP is used to evaluate the overall condition of the cellular system. If abnormal behavior is detected, local NPs are used in a component-wise fashion to find abnormal state variables. Anomaly detection tests are performed via percentile-based confidence intervals computed over the global and local NPs. We compared the performance of four competitive algorithms [winner-take-all (WTA), frequencysensitive competitive learning (FSCL), self or ganizing map (SOM), and neural-gas algorithm (NGA)] and the results suggest that the joint use of global and local NPs is more efficient and more robust than current single-threshold methods. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - The R-ratio heuristic for forest scheduling (Rodriguez, 1994) solves large scale 0-1 integer programming versions of the Type I harvest scheduling problem (Johnson and Scheurman, 1977). This paper reviews its foundations and describes its evolution until now. Heuristic scheduling system patterns are used to represent the problem, to describe the evaluation function and to monitor the solution process. Its logic and elements are presented based on some artificial intelligence (AI) principles proposed to build heuristic processes. An AI approach based on intelligent agents provides the basis to analyze the R-ratio's (i) escape strategy from local optima and (ii) its hybrid A*-greedy strategy to the solution search. AI concepts are also utilized to evaluate performance indicators of efficacy, measured by the proximity to the optimal solution of the non-integer linear programming relaxed version of the same problem, and efficiency, measured by penetrance and space complexity. For the test problems, the R-ratio strategy to escape from local optima proved efficacious given that several feasible solutions with objective function values bellow the range of 0.5% were obtained. And the R-ratio approach to find feasible solutions also proved efficient given its focus on a low cost strategy to select path searches.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach for the verification of the word hypotheses generated by a large vocabulary, offline handwritten word recognition system. Given a word image, the recognition system produces a ranked list of the N-best recognition hypothepes consisting of text transcripts, segmentation boundaries of the word hypotheses into characters, and recognition scores. The verification consists of an estimation of the probability of each segment representing a known class of character. Then, character probabi ities are combined to produce word confidence scores which are further integrated with the recognition scores produced by the recogni ion system. The N-best recognition hypothesis list is reranked based on such composite scores. In the end, rejection rules are invoke to either accept the best recognition hypothesis of such a list orto reject the input word image. The use of the verification approach has im oved the word recognition rate as well as the reliability of the recognition system, while not causing significant delays in the recogni ion process. Our approach is described in detail and the experimental results on a large database of unconstrained handwritten words extracted from postal envelopes are presented. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Although some research has been dedicated to the development of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) assistance mechanisms, little effort has been directed to the deployment of tools that assist humans during the KDD task definition stage. In order to satisfy this need for a KDD task definition assistance device, the present work proposes three different approaches: a) the first one is called theoretical approach and is based on concepts from the Theory of Attribute Equivalence in Databases [6] and from Topological Spaces [7]; b) the second employs Artificial Neural Networks [12] to learn mappings between heterogeneous patterns and is called experimental approach; c) the third one combines the abovementioned approaches to implement what is called hybrid approach. These approaches, examples, their definitions, models and implementations are described. Detailed experiments with real KDD applications, comparisons and conclusions are reported.

AB  - Reasoning with uncertain information is a central issue for Artificial Intelligence and Information Systems. Consequently, a vast amount of studies and results devoted to this issue can be found in the literature. Curiously, reasoning with information whose uncertaintyvaries along time cannot be found so much in the literature. Dynamic reliability is a feature found rather frequently in many problems, e.g. in financial markets, meteorology and demographics. In this article we consider propositions whose information about truth evaluation is gradually lost with time. Our motivation has come from the information system under development within the project SIDAM-Distributed Information Systems for Mobile Agents (supported by FAPESP, grant 98/06138-2) -to provide citizens with information about urban automotive traffic in a large city. We propose functions of loss of information, and show how they can be used to characterize the obsolescence of propositional information in a logical system. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Human-computer interaction (HCI) lies at the crossroads of many scientific areas including artificial intelligence, computer vision, face recognition, motion tracking, etc. It is argued that to truly achieve effective human-computer intelligent interaction, the computer should be able to interact naturally with the user, similar to the way HCI takes place. In this paper, we discuss training probabilistic classifiers with labeled and unlabeled data for HCI applications. We provide an analysis that shows under what conditions unlabeled data can be used in learning to improve classification performance, and we investigate the implications of this analysis to a specific type of probabilistic classifiers, Bayesian networks. Finally, we show how the resulting algorithms are successfully employed in facial expression recognition, face detection, and skin detection.

AB  - Large and complex systems (such as computer networks and power transmission systems) are difficult to operate and manage. Even when good remote managing capabilities are available, emergency situations prompt "alarm avalanches" that make diagnosis more difficult. This situation has prompted the development of intelligent alarm processing systems (IAP systems). Although it has been shown that IAP systems can be highly effective, most of them fail in practice due to the maintenance burden. In fact, most IAP systems require maintenance whenever the underlying monitored system changes. This paper presents the simplification and enhancement in maintainability of IAP systems made possible by separating topological information from the knowledge base (referred to as topology rule base). We investigate this idea in the context of a power transmission system, submitting to the same maintenance operations both a topology rule base IAP system and an identical traditional production system (i.e., one without topological information and with a topology-specific rule base). Our results confirm that the topology rule base substantially curtails the effort expended for typical maintenance procedures. Additionally, field experience in debugging an IAP system is described and the quality of the final system is characterized. © 2005 CRL Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Neural networks are a field of Computer Science related to Artificial Intelligence. The field aims at implementing mathematical models that are similar to biological neural structures. It is also capable of adapting its parameters as a result of interactions with the external environment, gradually improving their performance in the solution of a particular task. By using neural networks in computer information retrieval systems one can assign a dynamic character to those systems by allowing the representation of documents to be reevaluated and modified according to specifications of relevance attributed by users to retrieved documents. This work presents the main initiatives in applying neural networks concepts to information retrieval systems and evaluates its applicability to large document databases as is the case of the Web.

AB  - Background: Hormone profile evaluation traditionally requires an expert review of results for adequate laboratory section test release. Analysis of these results using Boolean rules is an interesting alternative to reduce the number of results that require manual review. Material and Method: We evaluated the utilization of Boolean rules using Instrument Manager software and Architect analyzer, mainly performing sex and thyroid hormones measurement. The intervention was evaluated on: a) number of rules and its easiness of construction; b) blind comparison of results evaluation by clinical pathologist (printed results) and set of rules in 940 consecutive tests. Results: Rule creation was a complex and arduous task, especially due to hormonal profiles with several different request patterns. It was necessary to use a set of 153 Boolean (if...then) rules, in a specific order. This set of rules agreed with expert opinion in 97.9% (920 tests). Rules hold 25 tests (2.7%) and the clinical pathologist only nine tests. There was discordance in 20 cases; rules did not hold only two cases: a beta-hCG in a male patient (that prompted the creation of a new rule) and a complete thyroid profile lacking only TSH request (pathologist opted to review the original request). Conclusion: Creation of an efficient set of Boolean rules proved to be a complex task requiring both technical and logics knowledge, but allowing optimization of laboratory workload. We achieved excellent concordance between the set of rules and clinical pathologist manual review, in a safe, fast and low cost system.

AB  - We analyze a simple opinion formation model consisting of two parties, A and B, and a group I, of undecided agents. We assume that the supporters of parties A and B do not interact among them, but only interact through the group I, and that there is a nonzero probability of a spontaneous change of opinion ( A ⇆ I, B ⇆ I ). From the master equation, and via van Kampen's Ω-expansion approach, we have obtained the "macroscopic" evolution equation, as well as the Fokker-Planck equation governing the fluctuations around the deterministic behavior. Within the same approach, we have also obtained information about the typical relaxation behavior of small perturbations.

AB  - The prevention of credit card fraud is an important commercial application for prediction methods and computational intelligence of pattern recognition approaches. Computational intelligence is an association of bio-inspired computational methodologies which are founded principally on neural networks, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence, and probabilistic computation. The application of computational intelligence techniques in the support of service tasks such as anomaly detection and identification, pattern classification, diagnostics, prognostics, estimation and control has recently emerged in industrial and commercial environments. This paper presents an efficient system based on computational intelligence methodologies for the detection of fraud in the operation of real credit card data in E-commerce transactions. This new proposed method, called FControl® for fraud detection and classification, integrates concepts of hybrid intelligent systems based on neural networks, fuzzy systems and evolutionary computation approaches. The proposed method generates quality solutions in terms of prediction efficiency and success. The computational program of the FControl® system has been installed on an Intel Pentium IV 2.4 MHz (bi-processor and 4 Gbytes RAM) at the company Ciashop E-Commerce and is currently in use for fraud detection by 250 companies that offer E-commerce services.

AB  - Objective: Research on clinical reasoning has been useful in developing expert systems. These tools are based on Artificial Intelligence techniques which assist the physician in the diagnosis of complex diseases. The development of these systems is based on a cognitive model extracted through the identification of the clinical reasoning patterns applied by experts within the clinical decision-making context. This study describes the method of knowledge acquisition for the identification of the triggering symptoms used in the reasoning of three experts for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Method: Three experts on schizophrenia, from two University centers in Sao Paulo, were interviewed and asked to identify and to represent the triggering symptoms for the diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the graph methodology. Results: Graph methodology showed a remarkable disagreement on how the three experts established their diagnosis of schizophrenia. They differed in their choice of triggering-symptoms for the diagnosis of schizophrenia: disorganization, blunted affect and thought disturbances. Conclusions: The results indicate substantial differences between the experts as to their diagnostic reasoning patterns, probably under the influence of different theoretical tendencies. The disorganization symptom was considered to be the more appropriate to represent the heterogeneity of schizophrenia and also, to further develop an expert system for the diagnosis of schizophrenia.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a method that selects a subset of the training data points to update LVQ prototypes. The main goal is to conduct the prototypes to converge at a more convenient location, diminishing misclassification errors. The method selects an update set composed by a subset of points considered to be at the risk of being captured by another class prototype. We associate the proposed methodology to a weighted norm, instead of the Euclidean, in order to establish different levels of relevance for the input attributes. The technique was implemented on a controlled experiment and on Web available data sets. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Clinical decision support systems are useful tools for assisting physicians to diagnose complex illnesses. Schizophrenia is a complex, heterogeneous and incapacitating mental disorder that should be detected as early as possible to avoid a most serious outcome. These artificial intelligence systems might be useful in the early detection of schizophrenia disorder. The objective of the present study was to describe the development of such a clinical decision support system for the diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SADDESQ). The development of this system is described in four stages: knowledge acquisition, knowledge organization, the development of a computer-assisted model, and the evaluation of the system's performance. The knowledge was extracted from an expert through open interviews. These interviews aimed to explore the expert's diagnostic decision-making process for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. A graph methodology was employed to identify the elements involved in the reasoning process. Knowledge was first organized and modeled by means of algorithms and then transferred to a computational model created by the covering approach. The performance assessment involved the comparison of the diagnoses of 38 clinical vignettes between an expert and the SADDESQ. The results showed a relatively low rate of misclassification (18-34%) and a good performance by SADDESQ in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, with an accuracy of 66-82%. The accuracy was higher when schizophreniform disorder was considered as the presence of schizophrenia disorder. Although these results are preliminary, the SADDESQ has exhibited a satisfactory performance, which needs to be further evaluated within a clinical setting. © Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research.

AB  - The process of casting occupies an important place in the metallurgical industry, and the entire world of the metal user. In the past, the ingot casting-rolling (slabbing, blooming, or billeting) process was commonly used. The continuous casting process has largely replaced this earlier method because of the inherent advantages of energy savings, enhanced productivity, higher yield and reduced costs. However, continuous casting process is not without of its problems. Considerable effort has been made by many researches to establish adequate design, operation and maintenance of continuous casting machine to ensure metallurgical quality of the final product. One of the most severe defects in continuous casting products is concerned with the cracks provoked by improper design of the spray cooling system. The aim of this work is to develop a two dimensional heat transfer model based on the finite difference method in order to calculate the strand temperatures and the solid shell profile along the machine. An Artificial Intelligence heuristic search procedure interacts with the numerical model to determine the improved cooling conditions for the sprays zones of a real continuous caster for the production of quality billets. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Summary: TRAP, the Tandem Repeats Analysis Program, is a Perl program that provides a unified set of analyses for the selection, classification, quantification and automated annotation of tandemly repeated sequences. TRAP uses the results of the Tandem Repeats Finder program to perform a global analysis of the satellite content of DNA sequences, permitting researchers to easily assess the tandem repeat content for both individual sequences and whole genomes. The results can be generated in convenient formats such as HTML and comma-separated values. TRAP can also be used to automatically generate annotation data in the format of feature table and GFF files. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes the development and implementation of a tool for the diagnosis of faults in power transformers through the analysis of dissolved gases in oil. The computational system approach is based on the combined use of some traditional criteria of the dissolved gas analysis published in standards, an artificial neural network, and a fuzzy logic system. The objective of the tool is to provide the user with an answer obtained from analysis not only of the traditional methods already consolidated in the technical literature, but also via artificial-intelligence techniques, reaching a higher degree of reliability with respect to each technique individually. The results obtained with this tool are promising in the diagnosis of incipient faults in transformers, reaching success levels of more than 80%. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - The spatial relation "between" is a notion which is intrinsically both fuzzy and contextual, and depends, in particular, on the shape of the objects. The literature is quite poor on this and the few existing definitions do not take into account these aspects. In particular, an object B that is in a concavity of an object A1 not visible from an object A2 is considered between A1 and A2 for most definitions, which is counter intuitive. Also, none of the definitions deal with cases where one object is much more elongated than the other. Here, we propose definitions which are based on convexity, morphological operators, and separation tools, and a fuzzy notion of visibility. They correspond to the main intuitive exceptions of the relation. We distinguish between cases where objects have similar spatial extensions and cases where one object is much more extended than the other. Extensions to cases where objects, themselves, are fuzzy and to three-dimensional space are proposed as well. The original work proposed in this paper covers the main classes of situations and overcomes the limits of existing approaches, particularly concerning nonvisible concavities and extended objects. Moreover, the definitions capture the intrinsic imprecision attached to this relation. The main proposed definitions are illustrated on real data from medical images. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents two approaches based on different artificial intelligence techniques (AI), genetic algorithms (GA) and neural networks (NN), for pattern recognition on the set of transient reactor signals. The first approach describes a possibilistic analysis based on the minimum centroids set method optimized by genetic algorithm. The use of a possibilistic classification provides a set of natural and consistent classification rules leading naturally to a good heuristic, based on the cluster size, to handle unlabeled transients by providing a 'don't know' response. In situations where the safety is the decisive parameter, this characteristic is fairly desirable in transient classification systems, since wrong or unreliable classifications can be catastrophic. Application of the proposed approach to a nuclear transient identification problem shows good capability of the genetic algorithm in learning optimized possibilistic classification rules for efficient diagnosis including 'don't know' response. The second approach uses two multilayer neural networks trained with the backpropagation algorithm. The first NN does a preliminary transient type identification using as inputs a short set (in a moving time window) of recent measurements of each variable. These inputs were presented to the NN, for each variable, as a set of consecutive values in temporal sequence. The second NN is used to validate the preliminary identification (from the first NN) through a self associative neural simulator used to estimate the value of every state variable. In order to validate both methods, a nuclear power plant (NPP) transient identification problem, comprising postulated accidents, is proposed. Noisy data was used in order to evaluate the method robustness. The results obtained reveal the ability of the methods in dealing with both dynamic identification of transients and correct 'don't know' response. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neural models of associative memories are usually concerned with the storage and the retrieval of binary or bipolar patterns. Thus far, the emphasis in research on morphological associative memory systems has been on binary models, although a number of notable features of autoassociative morphological memories (AMMs) such as optimal absolute storage capacity and one-step convergence have been shown to hold in the general, gray-scale setting. In this paper, we make extensive use of minimax algebra to analyze gray-scale autoassociative morphological memories. Specifically, we provide a complete characterization of the fixed points and basins of attractions which allows us to describe the storage and recall mechanisms of gray-scale AMMs. Computer simulations using gray-scale images illustrate our rigorous mathematical results on the storage capacity and the noise tolerance of gray-scale morphological associative memories (MAMs). Finally, we introduce a modified gray-scale AMM model that yields a fixed point which is closest to the input pattern with respect to the Chebyshev distance and show how gray-scale AMMs can be used as classifiers. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Ecological knowledge has been characterised as incomplete, fuzzy, uncertain, sparse, empirical, and non-formalised. It is often expressed in qualitative terms, verbally or diagrammatically. There is a need for new and efficient computer-based tools for making this knowledge explicit, well organised, processable, and integrated with quantitative knowledge. Qualitative reasoning is an area of artificial intelligence that creates representations for continuous aspects of the world to support reasoning with little information. Particularly relevant for our work are qualitative representations of differential equations, (in-)equality reasoning and the explicit representation of causal relationships between quantities. We present qualitative models and simulations of population and community dynamics in the Brazilian Cerrado vegetation. The models are organised in clusters of predictive simulation models. The first cluster implements a general theory of population dynamics, with the explicit representation of processes such as natality, mortality, immigration, emigration, colonisation, and population growth. These models are the basis for more complex community models. The second cluster represents interactions between two populations, such as symbiosis, competition, and predation. The third cluster represents the Cerrado succession hypothesis, a commonsense theory of succession in the Cerrado vegetation. It is assumed that fire frequency influences a number of environmental factors. When fire frequency increases succession leads to open grasslands and when fire frequency decreases the vegetation becomes woody and denser. This article shows the potential of qualitative reasoning for ecological modelling, particularly for answering questions of interest and making scientifically valid predictions using only qualitative terms. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Interictal spike detection is a time-consuming, low-efficiency task, but is important to epilepsy diagnosis. Automated systems reported to date usually have their practical efficacy compromised by elevated rates of false-positive detections per minute, which are caused mainly by the influence of artifacts (such as noise activity and ocular movements) and by the adoption of single or simple approaches. This work describes the development of a hybrid system for automatic detection of spikes in long-term electroencephalogram (EEG), named System for Automatic Detection of Epileptiform Events in EEG (SADE3), which uses wavelet transform, neural networks and artificial intelligence procedures to recognize epileptic and to reject non-epileptic activity. The system's pre-processing stage filters the EEG epochs with the Coiflet wavelet function, which showed the closest correlation to epileptogenic (EPG) activity, in opposition to some other wavelet functions that did not correlate with these events. In contrast to current attempts using continuous wavelet transform, we chose to work with fast wavelet transform to reduce processing time and data volume. Detail components at appropriate decomposition levels were used to accentuate spikes, sharp waves, high-frequency noise activity and ocular artifacts. These four detailed components were used to train four specialized neural networks, designed to detect and classify the EPG and non-EPG events. An expert module analyzes the networks' outputs, together with multichannel and context information and concludes the detection. The system was evaluated with 126,000 EEG epochs, obtained from seven different patients during long-term monitoring, under diverse behavior and mental states. More than 6,721 spikes and sharp waves were previously identified by three experienced human electroencephalographers. In these tests, the SADE3 system simultaneously achieved 70.9% sensitivity, 99.9% specificity and a rate of 0.13 false-positives per minute, indicating its usefulness and low vulnerability to artifact influence. After tests, the SADE3 system showed itself to be able to process bipolar cortical EEG records, from long-term monitoring, up to 32 channels, without any data preparation or event positioning. At the same time, SADE3 revealed a high capacity to reject non-epileptic paroxysms, robustness in relation to a variety of spike morphologies, flexibility in adjustment of performance rates and the capacity to actually save time during EEG reading. Furthermore, it can be adapted to other applications for pattern recognition, with simple adjustments. © International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering 2006.

AB  - We have developed a reversible method to convert color graphics and pictures to gray images. The method is based on mapping colors to low-visibility high-frequency textures that are applied onto the gray image. After receiving a monochrome textured image, the decoder can identify the textures and recover the color information. More specifically, the image is textured by carrying a subband (wavelet) transform and replacing bandpass subbands by the chrominance signals. The low-pass subband is the same as that of the luminance signal. The decoder performs a wavelet transform on the received gray image and recovers the chrominance channels. The intent is to print color images with black and white printers and to be able to recover the color information afterwards. Registration problems are discussed and examples are presented. © 2006 IEEE.

This technique is useful for minimizing data storage and transmission requirements for applications where multiple channels with high bandwidth data are digitized, such as telemedicine applications. The compression algorithm proposed in this work uses a discrete wavelet transform for spectral decomposition and an intelligent dynamic bit allocation scheme implemented by an approach using the Kohonen layer, which improves the bit allocation for sections of the S-EMG with different characteristics. Finally, data and overhead information are packed by entropy coding. The results for the compression of isometric EMG signals showed that this algorithm has a better performance than standard wavelet compression algorithms presented in the literature (presenting a decrease of at least 5% in per cent residual difference (PRD) for the same compression ratio), and a performance that is comparable with the performance of algorithms based on an embedded zero-tree wavelet. For isotonic EMG signals, its performance is better than the performance of the algorithms based on embedded zero-tree wavelets (presenting a decrease in PRD of about 3.6% for the same compression ratios, in the useful compression range). © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we provide an in-depth evaluation of the SOM as a feasible tool for nonlinear adaptive filtering. A comprehensive survey of existing SOM-based and related architectures for learning input-output mappings is carried out and the application of these architectures to nonlinear adaptive filtering is formulated. Then, we introduce two simple procedures for building RBF-based nonlinear filters using the Vector-Quantized Temporal Associative Memory (VQTAM), a recently proposed method for learning dynamical input-output mappings using the SOM. The aforementioned SOM-based adaptive filters are compared with standard FIR/LMS and FIR/LMS-Newton linear transversal filters, as well as with powerful MLP-based filters in nonlinear channel equalization and inverse modeling tasks. The obtained results in both tasks indicate that SOM-based filters can consistently outperform powerful MLP-based ones. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The importance of the efforts to bridge the gap between the connectionist and symbolic paradigms of artificial intelligence has been widely recognized. The merging of theory (background knowledge) and data learning (learning from examples) into neural-symbolic systems has indicated that such a learning system is more effective than purely symbolic or purely connectionist systems. Until recently, however, neural-symbolic systems were not able to fully represent, reason, and learn expressive languages other than classical propositional and fragments of first-order logic. In this article, we show that nonclassical logics, in particular propositional temporal logic and combinations of temporal and epistemic (modal) reasoning, can be effectively computed by artificial neural networks. We present the language of a connectionist temporal logic of knowledge (CTLK). We then present a temporal algorithm that translates CTLK theories into ensembles of neural networks and prove that the translation is correct. Finally, we apply CTLK to the muddy children puzzle, which has been widely used as a testbed for distributed knowledge representation. We provide a complete solution to the puzzle with the use of simple neural networks, capable of reasoning about knowledge evolution in time and of knowledge acquisition through learning. © 2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - The dynamic decay adjustment (DDA) algorithm is a fast constructive algorithm for training RBF neural networks (RBFNs) and probabilistic neural networks (PNNs). The algorithm has two parameters, namely, θ+ and θ-. The papers which introduced DDA argued that those parameters would not heavily influence classification performance and therefore they recommended using always the default values of these parameters. In contrast, this paper shows that smaller values of parameter θ- can, for a considerable number of datasets, result in strong improvement in generalization performance. The experiments described here were carried out using twenty benchmark classification datasets from both Proben1 and the UCI repositories. The results show that for eleven of the datasets, the parameter θ- strongly influenced classification performance. The influence of θ- was also noticeable, although much less, on six of the datasets considered. This paper also compares the performance of RBF-DDA with θ- selection with both AdaBoost and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). © World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - The eagerness of Internet and Intranet computing applications has fueled the complexity of the network administration tasks. Nowadays, the network management tools have usually insufficient resources to monitor the complexity of computer networks. The majority of the agents used in computer networks are passive agents, i.e., they have no autonomy, nor participate in the decision-making procedures. We have assessed multiple artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve network management systems, according to the autonomic computing concept introduced by IBM. In this paper, we present a methodology for agent's development based on artificial intelligence techniques. The reported results show that the proposed methodology is adequate to support the development of active agents.

AB  - In this paper, it is shown that vascular structures of the human retina represent geometrical multifractals, characterized by a hierarchy of exponents rather then a single fractal dimension. A number of retinal images from the STARE database are analyzed, corresponding to both normal and pathological states of the retina. In all studied cases, a clearly multifractal behavior is observed, where capacity dimension is always found to be larger then the information dimension, which is in turn always larger then the correlation dimension, all the three being significantly lower then the diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) fractal dimension. We also observe a tendency of images corresponding to the pathological states of the retina to have lower generalized dimensions and a shifted spectrum range, in comparison with the normal cases. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents an original hidden Markov model (HMM) approach for online beat segmentation and classification of electrocardiograms. The HMM framework has been visited because of its ability of beat detection, segmentation and classification, highly suitable to the electrocardiogram (ECG) problem. Our approach addresses a large panel of topics some of them never studied before in other HMM related works: waveforms modeling, multichannel beat segmentation and classification, and unsupervised adaptation to the patient's ECG. The performance was evaluated on the two-channel QT database in terms of waveform segmentation precision, beat detection and classification. Our waveform segmentation results compare favorably to other systems in the literature. We also obtained high beat detection performance with sensitivity of 99.79% and a positive predictivity of 99.96%, using a test set of 59 recordings. Moreover, premature ventricular contraction beats were detected using an original classification strategy. The results obtained validate our approach for real world application. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - This article describes the ExpertCop tutorial system, a simulator of crime in an urban region. In ExpertCop, the students (police officers) configure and allocate an available police force according to a selected geographic region and then interact with the simulation. The student interprets the results with the help of an intelligent tutor, the pedagogical agent, observing how crime behaves in the presence of the allocated preventive policing. The interaction between domain agents representing social entities as criminals and police teams drives the simulation. ExpertCop induces students to reflect on resource allocation. The pedagogical agent implements interaction strategies between the student and the geosimulator, designed to make simulated phenomena better understood. In particular, the agent uses a machine-learning algorithm to identify patterns in simulation data and to formulate questions to the student about these patterns.

AB  - This paper presents a preliminary study on the use of adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to determine the fragility curves in degraded nuclear power plant (NPP) passive components. The goal of this approach is to allow the direct association, using a mapping of input/output patterns, between measurable beam deflections and the structure probability of failure for a severe degradation condition. The present study consists of an Artificial Intelligence framework application considering the information obtained from an original Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) research program. The results indicate that the ANFIS modeling is a promising alternative to traditional approach in nuclear studies of structure degradation in passive components. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We present a method for automated segmentation of the vasculature in retinal images. The method produces segmentations by classifying each image pixel as vessel or nonvessel, based on the pixel's feature vector. Feature vectors are composed of the pixel's intensity and two-dimensional Gabor wavelet transform responses taken at multiple scales. The Gabor wavelet is capable of tuning to specific frequencies, thus allowing noise filtering and vessel enhancement in a single step. We use a Bayesian classifier with class-conditional probability density functions (likelihoods) described as Gaussian mixtures, yielding a fast classification, while being able to model complex decision surfaces. The probability distributions are estimated based on a training set of labeled pixels obtained from manual segmentations. The method's performance is evaluated on publicly available DRIVE (Staal et al., 2004) and STARE (Hoover et al., 2000) databases of manually labeled images. On the DRIVE database, it achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9614, being slightly superior than that presented by state-of-the-art approaches. We are making our implementation available as open source MATLAB scripts for researchers interested in implementation details, evaluation, or development of methods. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents the AFRANCI tool for the development of Multi-Strategy learning systems. Designing a Multi-Strategy system using AFRANCI is a two step process. The use interactively designs the structure of the system and then chooses the learning strategies for each module. After providing the datasets all modules as automatically trained. The system is aware and takes into consideration the inter-dependency of the modules. The tool has built-in learning algorithms but can use external programs implementing the learning algorithms. The tool has the following facilities. It allows any user to design in an interactive and easy fashion the structure of the target system. The structure of the target system is a collection of interconnected modules. The user may then choose the different learning algorithms to construct each module. The tool has several built-in Machine Learning algorithms has has interfaces that enables it to use external learning tools like WEKA and CN2. AFRANCI uses the interdependency of the modules to determine the sequence of training. For each module the system uses a wrapper to tune automatically the parameters of the learning algorithm. In the final step of the design sequence AFRANCI generates a compact and legible ready-to-use ANSI C open-source code for the final system.

AB  - The significance of collaborating grids for creating virtual cars by the auto firms and aerospace companies is discussed. The various advantages related to virtual cars include reduction in testing and design costs, more flexibility in design, and increased number of models offered by the companies. Auto firms have enlarged their grids to more than 1,000 CPUs for creating virtual cars. They have employed traditional applications as part of their service-oriented architecture (SOA) and employ many simulation and CAE applications on SOA. The firms are using SOA and grids to shift from a technology focus to a market or business focus. The collaboration grids, such as Grid 2.0, are used in the automotive and aerospace industries which includes large number of suppliers, and engineering partners. The collaboration grids are helping different simulation and design groups to operate as a team.

AB  - This article presents a tool that allows the user to generate intelligent systems. Initially, we show a Multi-Agent system called SMAGS, which has the ability of integrating different information systems and manage the information inherent to the project of interest in real time, as well as acting as a "Virtual Manager". Next, we included new Artificial Intelligence (IA) techniques with semantic interpretation and metrical testing to supply the user with a CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tool with the ability of generating intelligent computerized information systems, which can learn from information from intelligent searches in ontology servers, case bases, specialist in the area, or even from fragmented data from the Internet, with the purpose of enhancing decision taking. © Copyright 2010 IEEE - All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Background: Despite recent discoveries concerning molecular alterations involved in astrocytoma tumorigenesis, the conventional histological analysis remains the best diagnostic method and a reasonable prognostic indicator for astrocytic tumors. However, the histopathological routine recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) is laborious and marked by low reproducibility. Objective: The present study aimed to develop auxiliary strategies for astrocytic tumor graduation according to histological criteria established by WHO. Material and method: A clinical and epidemiological analysis and a histopathological evaluation were performed in 55 astrocytomas of different graduations (13 grade I, 14 grade II, seven grade III, 21 grade IV) and five samples of non-tumor tissue (control group). Results: The distribution by age, sex, and tumor localization of astrocytomas in patients reproduced, in a general way, worldwide trends. The presence of multinucleated cells and gemistocytes was associated with tumoral malignancy. The histopathological findings evaluated through semi-quantitative criteria and CART modeling confirmed the primary classification, reaffirming their applicability and reproducibility. Conclusion: These results indicate the CART decision tree and the totality of semi-quantitative scores as practical and auxiliary strategies for astrocytoma graduation as stated by WHO criteria.

AB  - Gradient dynamical systems with discontinuous righthand sides are designed using Persidskii-type nonsmooth Lyapunov functions to work as support vector machines (SVMs) for the discrimination of nonseparable classes. The gradient systems are obtained from an exact penalty method applied to the constrained quadratic optimization problems, which are formulations of two well known SVMs. Global convergence of the trajectories of the gradient dynamical systems to the solution of the corresponding constrained problems is shown to be independent of the penalty parameters and of the parameters of the SVMs. The proposed gradient systems can be implemented as simple analog circuits as well as using standard software for integration of ODEs, and in order to use efficient integration methods with adaptive stepsize selection, the discontinuous terms are smoothed around a neighborhood of the discontinuity surface by means of the boundary layer technique. The scalability of the proposed gradient systems is also shown by means of an implementation using parallel computers, resulting in smaller processing times when compared with traditional SVM packages. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes a novel solution to the rigid point pattern matching problem in Euclidean spaces of any dimension. Although we assume rigid motion, jitter is allowed. We present a noniterative, polynomial time algorithm that is guaranteed to find an optimal solution for the noiseless case. First, we model point pattern matching as a weighted graph matching problem, where weights correspond to Euclidean distances between nodes. We then formulate graph matching as a problem of finding a maximum probability configuration in a graphical model. By using graph rigidity arguments, we prove that a sparse graphical model yields equivalent results to the fully connected model in the noiseless case. This allows us to obtain an algorithm that runs in polynomial time and is provably optimal for exact matching between noiseless point sets. For inexact matching, we can still apply the same algorithm to find approximately optimal solutions. Experimental results obtained by our approach show improvements in accuracy over current methods, particularly when matching patterns of different sizes. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Statistical quality control - SQC (consisting of Statistical Process Control, Process Capability Studies, Acceptance Sampling and Design of Experiments) is a very important tool to obtain, maintain and improve the Quality level of goods and services produced by an organization. Despite its importance, and the fact that it is taught in technical and college courses, as well as in companies' training sectors, SQC has been largely misused. An inappropriate teaching approach may be the cause of such problem; therefore it has motivated the development of a model for SQC teaching, allowing its learners to correctly apply SQC techniques. After a survey regarding the concept needed to correctly apply SQC, its use and teaching/training methods, the model's contents and methodology were defined. We also realized the opportunity of incorporating a computer environment for the model, permitting the practice of the needed SQC concepts and skills. An Artificial Intelligence approach was used to develop the computer environment, resulting in an Intelligent Tutoring System, the STCEQ. The paper discusses the main characteristics of the system, its functioning, benefits of using such a system and the results we obtained while using this system. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper discusses questions about communication of probabilistic knowledge in the light of current theories of agent communication. It will argue that there is a semantic gap between these theories and research areas related to probabilistic knowledge representation and communication, that creates very serious theoretical problems if agents that reason probabilistically try to use the communication framework provided by these theories. The paper proposes a new formal model, which generalizes current agent communication theories (at least the standard FIPA version of these theories) to handle probabilistic knowledge communication. We propose a new probabilistic logic as the basis for the model and new communication principles and communicative acts to support this kind of communication. © 2006 International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - In this paper we present an effective prover for mbC, a minimal inconsistency logic. The mbC logic is a paraconsistent logic of the family of logics of formal inconsistency. Paraconsistent logics have several philosophical motivations as well as many applications in Artificial Intelligence such as in belief revision, inconsistent knowledge reasoning, and logic programming. We have implemented the KEMS prover for mbC, a theorem prover based on the KE tableau method for mbC We show here that the proof system on which this prover is based is sound, complete and analytic. To evaluate the KEMS prover for mbC, we devised four families of mbC-valid formulas and we present here the first benchmark results using these families. © 2006 International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - This article intends to make an analysis about the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Knowledge Management (KM). Faced with the dualism mind and body how we be able to see it AI? It doesn't intent to create identical copy of human being, but try to find the better form to represent all the knowledge contained in our minds. The society of the information lives a great paradox, at the same time that we have access to an innumerable amount of information, the capacity and the forms of its processing are very limited. In this context, institutions and centers of research devote themselves to the finding of ways to use to advantage the available data consistently. The interaction of the Knowledge Management with Artificial Intelligence makes possible the development of filtering tools and pre-analysis of the information that appear as a reply to the expectations to extract resulted optimized of databases and open and not-structuralized source, as the Internet. © 2006 International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - This paper introduces a fuzzy rule-based method for the recognition of hand gestures acquired from a data glove, with an application to the recognition of some sample hand gestures of LIBRAS, the Brazilian Sign Language. The method uses the set of angles of finger joints for the classification of hand configurations, and classifications of segments of hand gestures for recognizing gestures. The segmentation of gestures is based on the concept of monotonic gesture segment, sequences of hand configurations in which the variations of the angles of the finger joints have the same sign (non-increasing or non-decreasing). Each gesture is characterized by its list of monotonic segments. The set of all lists of segments of a given set of gestures determine a set of finite automata, which are able to recognize every such gesture. © 2006 International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - CO-TRAINING can learn from datasets having a small number of labelled examples and a large number of unlabelled ones. It is an iterative algorithm where examples labelled in previous iterations are used to improve the classification of examples from the unlabelled set. However, as the number of initial labelled examples is often small we do not have reliable estimates regarding the underlying population which generated the data. In this work we make the claim that the proportion in which examples are labelled is a key parameter to CO-TRAINING. Furthermore, we have done a series of experiments to investigate how the proportion in which we label examples in each step influences CO-TRAINING performance. Results show that CO-TRAINING should be used with care in challenging domains. © 2006 International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - Cultural differences play a very important role in matching computer interfaces to the expectations of users from different national and cultural backgrounds. But to date, there has been little systematic research as to the extent of such differences, and how to produce software that automatically takes into account these differences. We are studying these issues using a unique resource: Common Sense knowledge bases in different languages. Our research points out that this kind of knowledge can help computer systems to consider cultural differences. We describe our experiences with knowledge bases containing thousands of sentences describing people and everyday activities, collected from volunteer Web contributors in three different cultures: Brazil, Mexico and the USA, and software which automatically searches for cultural differences amongst the three cultures, alerting the user to potential differences. © 2006 International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - Automated Collaborative Filtering (CF) techniques have been successfully applied on Recommendation domains. Dellarocas [1] proposes their use on reputation domains to provide more reliable and personalized reputation estimates. Despite being solved by recommendation field researches (e.g. significance weighting [2]), the problem of selecting low-trusted neighborhoods finds new roots in the reputation domain, mostly related to different behavior by the evaluated participants. It can turn evaluators with similar tastes into distant ones, contributing to poor reputation rates. A Reputation Model is proposed to minimize those problems. It uses CF techniques adjusted with the following improvements: 1) information of evaluators taste profiles is added to the user evaluation history; 2) transformations are applied on user evaluation history based on the similarities between the taste profiles of the active user and of the other evaluators to identify more reliable neighborhoods. An experiment is implemented through a simulated electronic marketplace where buyers choose sellers based on reputation estimates generated by the proposed reputation model and by a model that uses traditional CF. The goal is to compare the proposed model performance with the traditional one through comparative analysis of the data that is created. The results are explained at the end of the paper. © 2006 International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - The development of new tools for chemoinformatics, allied to the use of different algorithms and computer programmes for structure elucidation of organic compounds, is growing fast worldwide. Massive efforts in research and development are currently being pursued both by academia and the so-called chemistry software development companies. The demystification of this environment provoked by the availability of software packages and a vast array of publications exert a positive impact on chemistry. In this work, an overview concerning the more classical approaches as well as new strategies on computer-based tools for structure elucidation of organic compounds is presented. Historical background is also taken into account since these techniques began to develop around four decades ago. Attention will be paid to companies which develop, distribute or commercialize software as well as web-based and open access tools which are currently available to chemists.

AB  - The goal of the Cognitive Robotics research area is to develop robotic agents capable of high-level functions by using a programming language, based on logics, to describe the robot control program. Besides, such a language can be used to prove properties of the world and to simulate the robot behavior by running its program. This paper shows how a Lego® MindStorms™ robot can be used to implement a software agent capable of performing high level functions specified in IndiGolog - a logical language to write robot control programs, based on Situation Calculus. The application domain example is the classical problem of the Wumpus World for which the construction of a complete intelligent agent requires the integration of several Artificial Intelligence techniques, such as: reactive planning; hierarquical and goal achievement planning; plan execution; reasoning with incomplete information; generation and discrimination of hypotheses about the world state; and belief changes.

AB  - High performance grinding implies in reliable monitoring at high speeds. In this paper, the development of a dressing monitoring system based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) is discussed. Different from previous works that adopt AI to classify Acoustic Emission (AE) measurements in grinding operations, the proposed approach is less sensitive to noise. The results point out to increases in production velocity and quality. Simulated tests indicate to the high performance of the monitoring even in noise conditions.

AB  - Proliferative diabetic retinopathy can lead to blindness. However, early recognition allows appropriate, timely intervention. Fluorescein-labeled retinal blood vessels of 27 digital images were automatically segmented using the Gabor wavelet transform and classified using traditional features such as area, perimeter, and an additional five morphological features based on the derivatives-of-Gaussian wavelet-derived data. Discriminant analysis indicated that traditional features do not detect early proliferative retinopathy. The best single feature for discrimination was the wavelet curvature with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.76. Linear discriminant analysis with a selection of six features achieved an AUC of 0.90 (0.73-0.97, 95% confidence interval). The wavelet method was able to segment retinal blood vessels and classify the images according to the presence or absence of proliferative retinopathy. © 2007 Optical Society of America.

AB  - Digitization is not as easy as it looks. If one digitizes a 3D object even with a dense sampling grid, the reconstructed digital object may have topological distortions and, in general, there exists no upper bound for the Hausdorff distance. This explains why so far no algorithm has been known which guarantees topology preservation. However, as we will show, it is possible to repair the obtained digital image in a locally bounded way so that it is homeomorphic and close to the 3D object. The resulting digital object is always well-composed, which has nice implications for a lot of image analysis problems. Moreover, we will show that the surface of the original object is homeomorphic to the result of the marching cubes algorithm. This is really surprising since it means that the well-known topological problems of the marching cubes reconstruction simply do not occur for digital images of r-regular objects. Based on the trilinear interpolation, we also construct a smooth isosurface from the digital image that has the same topology as the original surface. Finally, we give a surprisingly simple topology preserving reconstruction method by using overlapping balls instead of cubical voxels. This is the first approach of digitizing 3D objects which guarantees topology preservation and gives an upper bound for the geometric distortion. Since the output can be chosen as a pure voxel presentation, a union of balls, a reconstruction by trilinear interpolation, a smooth isosurface, or the piecewise linear marching cubes surface, the results are directly applicable to a huge class of image analysis algorithms. Moreover, we show how one can efficiently estimate the volume and the surface area of 3D objects by looking at their digitizations. Measuring volume and surface area of digital objects are important problems in 3D image analysis. Good estimators should be multigrid convergent, i.e., the error goes to zero with increasing sampling density. We will show that every presented reconstruction method can be used for volume estimation and we will give a solution for the much more difficult problem of multigrid-convergent surface area estimation. Our solution is based on simple counting of voxels and we are the first to be able to give absolute bounds for the surface area. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach to QRS segmentation based on the combination of two techniques: wavelet bases and adaptive threshold. Firstly, QRS complexes are identified without a preprocessing stage. Then, each QRS is segmented by identifying the complex onset and offset. We evaluated the algorithm on two manually annotated databases, the QT-database and the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The QRS detector obtained a sensitivity of 99.02% and a positive predictivity of 99.35% over the first lead of the validation databases (more than 192,000 beats), while for the QT-database, values larger than 99.6% were attained. As for the delineation of the QRS complex, the mean and the standard deviation of the differences between the automatic and the manual annotations were computed. Using QT-database which contains recordings of annotated ECG with a sampling rate of 250 Hz, we obtain the average of the differences not exceeding two sampling intervals, while the standard deviations were within acceptable range of values. © 2006 IPEM.

AB  - Expert systems are proposed in order to analyze thermogravimetric profiles. The methodology showed to be an efficient tool as a complementary procedure for experimentalists in the area of themogravimetric analysis. Several simple and complex molecules were used to validate the developed methodology. The advantage of the actual approach can be attributed to its efficient error minimization for each weigh loss and global process. In addition, the proposed expert system presents a low computational demanding. The validation analysis using compounds such as salicylato (amine) Co (III) complexes, norfloxacin complexes of manganese (II) and cobalt (II), and calcium borate produced an average confidence interval of about 2%. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - CMOS technology miniaturization limits have promoted research on new alternatives which can keep the technologically advanced level of the last decades. Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is a new technology in the nanometer scale that has been considered as one of these alternatives. QCA have a large potential in the development of circuits with high space density and low heat dissipation and allow the development of faster computers with lower power consumption. Differently from conventional technologies, QCA do not codify information by means of electric current flow, but rather by the configuration of electrical charges in the interior of the cells. The Coulomb interaction between cells is responsible for the flow of information. This paper proposes the use of computational intelligence techniques in the simulation and in the automatic synthesis of QCA circuits. The first results show that these techniques may play an important role in this research area since they are capable of simulating efficiently and fast, synthesizing optimized circuits with a reduced number of cells. Such optimization reduces the possibility of failures and guarantees higher speed. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - In this letter, we study online learning in neural networks (NNs) obtained by approximating Bayesian learning. The approach is applied to Gibbs learning with the Rosenblatt potential in a nonstationary environment. The online scheme is obtained by the minimization (maximization) of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (cross entropy) between the true posterior distribution and the parameterized one. The complexity of the learning algorithm is further decreased by projecting the posterior onto a Gaussian distribution and imposing a spherical covariance matrix. We study in detail the particular case of learning linearly separable rules. In the case of a fixed rule, we observe an asymptotic generalization error eg ∝ α-1 for both the spherical and the full covariance matrix approximations. However, in the case of drifting rule, only the full covariance matrix algorithm shows a good performance. This good performance is indeed a surprise since the algorithm is obtained by projecting without the benefit of the extra information on drifting. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception Laboratory demonstrated a smart wheelchair, called Smart Chair that uses intelligent controllers to help physically challenged people overcome their difficulties. The wheelchair was fitted with cameras, a laser range finder, and onboard processing system to provide users with an adaptable and intelligent control system. A human user was able to interact with the Smart Chair effortlessly in real time, while it performed an autonomous task. The flexibility enabled the human user and the autonomous system share control of the motion of the human body. The human operator was able to specify destinations, using a simple visual interface by pointing to locations or features on a display. This input enabled the chair automatically generate a deliberative plan incorporating prior knowledge, helping the user avoid obstacles and move about freely.

AB  - Some sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) are the active compounds of a great number of traditionally medicinal plants from the Asteraceae family and possess considerable cytotoxic activity. Several studies in vitro have shown the inhibitory activity against cells derived from human carcinoma of the nasopharynx (KB). In this study, we investigated a set of 37 different sesquiterpene lactones, represented by 4 skeletons (14 germacranolides, 6 elemanolides, 9 guaianolides and nor-derivatives, and 8 pseudoguaianolides), in what it says respect of their cytotoxic properties. The experimental results were submitted to a QSAR study. A single model for the entire data set was described using 3D molecular descriptors and genetic algorithms establishing structure-activity relationships among the compounds. Important properties for the inhibition potency are discussed for the whole data set and for subsets of the different structural skeletons. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this letter, we derive continuum equations for the generalization error of the Bayesian online algorithm (BOnA) for the one-layer perceptron with a spherical covariance matrix using the Rosenblatt potential and show, by numerical calculations, that the asymptotic performance of the algorithm is the same as the one for the optimal algorithm found by means of variational methods with the added advantage that the BOnA does not use any inaccessible information during learning. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of splice site prediction, by applying stochastic grammar inference. We used four grammar inference algorithms to infer 1465 grammars, and used 10-fold cross-validation to select the best grammar for each algorithm. The corresponding grammars were embedded into a classifier and used to run splice site prediction and compare the results with those of NNSPLICE, the predictor used by the Genie gene finder. We indicate possible paths to improve this performance by using Sakakibara's windowing technique to find probability thresholds that will lower falsepositive predictions. ©FUNPEC-RP.

AB  - This paper describes part of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system that has been developed for mammograms. Details are presented of methods implemented to derive measures of similarity based upon structural characteristics and distributions of density of the fibroglandular tissue, as well as the anatomical size and shape of the breast region as seen on the mammogram. Well-known features related to shape, size, and texture (statistics of the gray-level histogram, Haralick's texture features, and moment-based features) were applied, as well as less-explored features based in the Radon domain and granulometric measures. The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) neural network was used to perform the retrieval operation. Performance evaluation was done using precision and recall curves obtained from comparison between the query and retrieved images. The proposed methodology was tested with 1,080 mammograms, including craniocaudal and mediolateral-oblique views. Precision rates obtained are in the range from 79% to 83% considering the total image set. Considering the first 50% of the retrieved mages, the precision rates are in the range from 78% to 83%; the rates are in the range from 79% to 86% considering the first 25% of the retrieved images. Results obtained indicate the potential of the implemented methodology to serve as a part of a CBIR system for mammography. © 2007 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.

AB  - In this work we propose a new approach for fast visualization and exploration of virtual worlds based on the use of cartographic concepts and techniques. Versions of cartographic maps with different levels of details can be created by using a set of operations named cartographic generalization. Cartographic generalization employs twelve operators and domain-specific knowledge, being the contribution of this work their transposition to 3D virtual worlds. The architecture of a system for 3D generalization is proposed and the system is implemented. Differently from traditional cartographic processes, we use artificial intelligence for both selecting the key objects and applying the operators. As a case study, we present the simplification of the historical quarter of Recife (Brazil). © Springer-Verlag 2007.

AB  - We developed a detailed computational model of an olfactory sensory neuron to investigate the functional properties of the sensory adaptation in the peripheral olfactory system. The model consists of a system of first-order differential equations that describes the time course of the different components considered, including the biochemical pathways in the cilia and the electrical compartments that represent the cilia, the dendrite, dendritic knob, the cell body and the initial segment of the axon. We used different protocols of stimulation to investigate the response of the model to constant or transient stimuli. In this way, it was possible to explore the occurrence of two types of adaptation mediated by distinct processes in the same cell. The results of the model suggest that different respiratory frequencies during sniffing behavior could be used by animals as a mechanism to avoid adaptation to odorants at the receptor cell level. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Making a decision on where would be the best location to sell a product is the most crucial task in any market sector. However, this is a complex undertaking since it involves numerous variables, not only related to space, but also related to subjectivity and symbolism and often related to personal opinions. Taking into consideration that the decision on the location involves many variables as to space as well as symbolic variables, this paper presents the integration of a Geographical Information System (GIS) with an Expert System (ES) in order to help with the decision taking process of where to start a new retailer in the banking sector, in this case within the HSBC Bank Brazil S/A, Multiple Banking, Department of Real Estate Administration for the area of the city of Curitiba, Parand. The system was developed in several steps. To implement GIS ArcGIS was used and to develop the Expert System it was used a shell, named Expert SINTA. The user interface was developed by using programming language Visual Basic. A comparison was made between the methodology used of the specialists of the Department of Real Estate Administration and the proposed system in order to validate the results. The conclusion was that the integration of the systems contributed to an improvement within the decision maping process as to the location in the banking sector, enlarging the possibilities of the spatial analysis and helping the experts with the tasks that involve subjective estimations and often opinions.

AB  - 2D QSAR studies were carried out for a series of 55 ligands for the Thyroid receptors, TRα and TRβ. Significant cross-validated correlation coefficients (q2 = 0.781 (TRα) and 0.693 (TRβ)) were obtained. The models' predictive abilities were proved more valuable than the classical 2D-QSAR, and were further investigated by means of an external test set of 13 compounds. The predicted values are in good agreement with experimental values, suggesting that the models could be useful in the design of novel, more potent TR ligands. Contribution map analysis identified a number of positions that are promising for the development of receptor isoform specific ligands. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Transcript enumeration methods such as SAGE, MPSS, and sequencing-by-synthesis EST "digital northern", are important high-throughput techniques for digital gene expression measurement. As other counting or voting processes, these measurements constitute compositional data exhibiting properties particular to the simplex space where the summation of the components is constrained. These properties are not present on regular Euclidean spaces, on which hybridization-based microarray data is often modeled. Therefore, pattern recognition methods commonly used for microarray data analysis may be non-informative for the data generated by transcript enumeration techniques since they ignore certain fundamental properties of this space. Results: Here we present a software tool, Simcluster, designed to perform clustering analysis for data on the simplex space. We present Simcluster as a stand-alone command-line C package and as a user-friendly on-line tool. Both versions are available at: http://xerad.systemsbiology.net/simcluster. Conclusion: Simcluster is designedin accordance with a well-established mathematical framework for compositional data analysis, which provides principled procedures for dealing with the simplex space, and is thus applicable in a number of contexts, including enumeration-based gene expression data. © 2007 Vêncio et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Inspired by the biological nerve system, artificial neural networks (ANN) have been tools of artificial intelligence for data classification and pattern recognition, and can be used to simulate a wide variety of non-linear complex scientific systems. Artificial neural networks are being used in medical applications; image recognition and control of dynamic systems, but only recently have been considered for the prediction of the mechanical behavior of materials and particularly composites. In this work, ANNs were considered specifically to predict the shear stress-strain behavior from carbon fiber/epoxy and glass fiber/epoxy composites. A multilayered neural network perceptron (MLP) architecture was used, and the results showed that the application of the Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm leads to a high predictive quality to epoxy composites, i.e. nearly 80% of standard error of prediction was found to be ≥0.9. The initial tests considered a simple architecture 3-[3-3]2-1 resulting in low predictive quality. However, increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layers and the number of training instances resulted in an enhancement of the neural network predictive quality. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper proposes an extension to the model of a spiking neuron for information processing in artificial neural networks, developing a new approach for the dynamic threshold of the integrate-and-fire neuron. This new approach invokes characteristics of biological neurons such as the behavior of chemical synapses and the receptor field. We demonstrate how such a digital model of spiking neurons can solve complex nonlinear classification with a single neuron, performing experiments for the classical XOR problem. Compared with rate-coded networks and the classical integrate-and-fire model, the trained network demonstrated faster information processing, requiring fewer neurons and shorter learning periods. The extended model validates all the logic functions of biological neurons when such functions are necessary for the proper flow of binary codes through a neural network. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Bioprocesses are quite difficult and expensive to model, since their operation involves microbial growth under constantly changing conditions, with impact on process kinetics and performance. Hence, there is a need and incentive for the improvement of methods for rapid development of simple, though realistic, mathematical models. In this work the modeling of biotechnological processes is studied with focus on developing methodologies that can be used whenever a re-estimation of parameters is necessary. The ethanol fermentation process is used as a case study. The performance of a hybrid neural model and a balance based model, both considering the effect of temperature on the kinetics, are evaluated not only by their accuracy in describing experimental data, but also by the difficulties involved in the adaptation of their parameters. Experiments are performed to develop the two models and further experiments (using sugar cane molasses from a different harvest and a different production medium) validate the methodologies for re-estimation of kinetic parameters. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a dysphonic voice classification system using the wavelet packet transform and the best basis algorithm (BBA) as dimensionality reductor and 06 artificial neural networks (ANN) acting as specialist systems. Each ANN was a 03-layer multilayer perceptron with 64 input nodes, 01 output node and in the intermediary layer the number of neurons depends on the related training pathology group. The dysphonic voice database was separated in five pathology groups and one healthy control group. Each ANN was trained and associated with one of the 06 groups, and fed by the best base tree (BBT) nodes' entropy values, using the multiple cross validation (MCV) method and the leave-one-out (LOO) variation technique and success rates obtained were 87.5%, 95.31%, 87.5%, 100%, 96.87% and 89.06% for the groups 01 to 06, respectively. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Detecting groups of functionally related proteins from their amino acid sequence alone has been a long-standing challenge in computational genome research. Several clustering approaches, following different strategies, have been published to attack this problem. Today, new sequencing technologies provide huge amounts of sequence data that has to be efficiently clustered with constant or increased accuracy, at increased speed. Results: We advocate that the model of weighted cluster editing, also known as transitive graph projection is well-suited to protein clustering. We present the FORCE heuristic that is based on transitive graph projection and clusters arbitrary sets of objects, given pairwise similarity measures. In particular, we apply FORCE to the problem of protein clustering and show that it outperforms the most popular existing clustering tools (Spectral clustering, TribeMCL, GeneRAGE, Hierarchical clustering, and Affinity Propagation). Furthermore, we show that FORCE is able to handle huge datasets by calculating clusters for all 192 187 prokaryotic protein sequences (66 organisms) obtained from the COG database. Finally, FORCE is integrated into the corynebacterial reference database CoryneRegNet. Conclusion: FORCE is an applicable alternative to existing clustering algorithms. Its theoretical foundation, weighted cluster editing, can outperform other clustering paradigms on protein homology clustering. FORCE is open source and implemented in Java. The software, including the source code, the clustering results for COG and CoryneRegNet, and all evaluation datasets are available at http://gi.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/comet/force/. © 2007 Wittkop et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Artificial neural networks and fuzzy systems, have gradually established themselves as a popular tool in approximating complicated nonlinear systems and time series forecasting. This paper investigates the hypothesis that the nonlinear mathematical models of multilayer perceptron and radial basis function neural networks and the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy system are able to provide a more accurate out-of-sample forecast than the traditional auto regressive moving average (ARMA) and ARMA generalized auto regressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARMA-GARCH) linear models. Using series of Brazilian exchange rate (R$/US$) returns with 15 min, 60 min and 120 min, daily and weekly basis, the one-step-ahead forecast performance is compared. Results indicate that forecast performance is strongly related to the series' frequency and the forecasting evaluation shows that nonlinear models perform better than their linear counterparts. In the trade strategy based on forecasts, nonlinear models achieve higher returns when compared to a buy-and-hold strategy and to the linear models. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Remote homology detection is a challenging problem in Bioinformatics. Arguably, profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) are one of the most successful approaches in addressing this important problem. pHMM packages present a relatively small computational cost, and perform particularly well at recognizing remote homologies. This raises the question of whether structural alignments could impact the performance of pHMMs trained from proteins in the Twilight Zone, as structural alignments are often more accurate than sequence alignments at identifying motifs and functional residues. Next, we assess the impact of using structural alignments in pHMM performance. Results: We used the SCOP database to perform our experiments. Structural alignments were obtained using the 3DCOFFEE and MAMMOTH-mult tools; sequence alignments were obtained using CLUSTALW, TCOFFEE, MAFFT and PROBCONS. We performed leave-one-family-out cross-validation over super-families. Performance was evaluated through ROC curves and paired two tailed t-test. Conclusion: We observed that pHMMs derived from structural alignments performed significantly better than pHMMs derived from sequence alignment in low-identity regions, mainly below 20%. We believe this is because structural alignment tools are better at focusing on the important patterns that are more often conserved through evolution, resulting in higher quality pHMMs. On the other hand, sensitivity of these tools is still quite low for these low-identity regions. Our results suggest a number of possible directions for improvements in this area. © 2007 Bernardes et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Several mathematical and statistical methods have been proposed in the last few years to analyze microarray data. Most of those methods involve complicated formulas, and software implementations that require advanced computer programming skills. Researchers from other areas may experience difficulties when they attempting to use those methods in their research. Here we present an user-friendly toolbox which allows large-scale gene expression analysis to be carried out by biomedical researchers with limited programming skills. Results: Here, we introduce an user-friendly toolbox called GEDI (Gene Expression Data Interpreter), an extensible, open-source, and freely-available tool that we believe will be useful to a wide range of laboratories, and to researchers with no background in Mathematics and Computer Science, allowing them to analyze their own data by applying both classical and advanced approaches developed and recently published by Fujita et al. Conclusion: GEDI is an integrated user-friendly viewer that combines the state of the art SVR, DVAR and SVAR algorithms, previously developed by us. It facilitates the application of SVR, DVAR and SVAR, further than the mathematical formulas present in the corresponding publications, and allows one to better understand the results by means of available visualizations. Both running the statistical methods and visualizing the results are carried out within the graphical user interface, rendering these algorithms accessible to the broad community of researchers in Molecular Biology. © 2007 Fujita et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - In this work a computer-aided tool to modelling of biotechnological processes is built up with focus on developing methodologies that can be used always that a re-estimation of parameters is necessary. The ethanol fermentation process is used as a case study. The performance of a hybrid neural model and a firstprinciples model, both considering the effect of temperature on the kinetics, are evaluated not only by their accuracy in describing experimental data, but mainly by the difficulties involved in the adaptation of their parameters. The results show that the proposed tool is very efficient to follow changes in operating conditions and their impact on the system kinetics which is an important issue to lead the process to be operated at high level of performance. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work describes an innovative medical nanorobot architecture based on important discoveries in nanotechnology, integrated circuit patents, and some publications, directly or indirectly related to one of the most challenging new fields of science: molecular machines. Thus, the architecture described in this paper reflects, and is supported by, some remarkable recent achievements and patents in nanoelectronics, wireless communication and power transmission techniques, nanotubes, lithography, biomedical instrumentation, genetics, and photonics. We also describe how medicine can benefit from the joint development of nanodevices which are derived, and which integrate techniques, from artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and embedded smart sensors. Teleoperated surgical procedures, early disease diagnosis, and pervasive patient monitoring are some possible applications of nanorobots, reflecting progress along a roadmap for the gradual and practical development of nanorobots. To illustrate the described nanorobot architecture, a computational 3D approach with the application of nanorobots for diabetes is simulated using clinical data. Theoretical and practical analysis of system integration modeling is one important aspect for supporting the rapid development in the emerging field of nanotechnology. This provides useful directions for further research and development of medical nanorobotics and suggests a time frame in which nanorobots may be expected to be available for common utilization in therapeutic and medical procedures. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Background: Making diagnoses in oral pathology are often difficult and confusing in dental practice, especially for the lessexperienced dental student. One of the most promising areas in bioinformatics is computer-aided diagnosis, where a computer system is capable of imitating human reasoning ability and provides diagnoses with an accuracy approaching that of expert professionals. This type of system could be an alternative tool for assisting dental students to overcome the difficulties of the oral pathology learning process. This could allow students to define variables and information, important to improving the decision-making performance. However, no current open data management system has been integrated with an artificial intelligence system in a user-friendly environment. Such a system could also be used as an education tool to help students perform diagnoses. The aim of the present study was to develop and test an open case-based decisionsupport system. Methods: An open decision-support system based on Bayes' theorem connected to a relational database was developed using the C++ programming language. The software was tested in the computerisation of a surgical pathology service and in simulating the diagnosis of 43 known cases of oral bone disease. The simulation was performed after the system was initially filled with data from 401 cases of oral bone disease. Results: The system allowed the authors to construct and to manage a pathology database, and to simulate diagnoses using the variables from the database. Conclusion: Combining a relational database and an open decision-support system in the same user-friendly environment proved effective in simulating diagnoses based on information from an updated database. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2007.

AB  - This paper introduces AMPLIA, an intelligent learning environment employed as a resource in medical students’ training. The development of AMPLIA raised several research topics, due to the convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Learning Environments. The core topics are: probabilistic diagnostic learning in the medical area, application of teaching strategies based on Pedagogical Negotiation (PN), construction of cognitive student models with probabilistic beliefs, and application of interoperability methods for pedagogical agents, and tutoring systems integration. An important aspect of AMPLIA is the utilization of PN as the main form of interaction. The impact of this approach on the system dynamics and on the student’s learning is presented in detail. Considering the importance of cooperative work during the learning process, we describe how AMPLIA is used to enable cooperation. The description is based on experiments carried out with AMPLIA and its users. The main results of these experiments are reported as well. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - One of the main obstacles to the socio-economic development of the Brazilian Amazon is the lack of electric energy in the numerous small isolated communities of the region that hampers value-added agricultural production, revenue growth and creation of jobs. One way to solve this problem is by setting up micro-hydro power (MHP) plants under a sustainable development perspective. This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) that analyzes this solution. The system considers the hydrological, topographical, geotechnical, environmental, energy, economic and social aspects of the target site. A detailed analysis is made of the hydrological model that employs a rainfall run-off model for small catchment analysis; the energy planning favors a two-turbine method to determine the maximum energy production during demand peaks, and the economic aspects show that the costs of energy generated by MHP plants are comparable to those from rural grid systems and lower than those from from diesel generators. Thus, the use of the hydro-power resources of the small catchments of Amazonia combined with the minimization of the environmental impacts caused by MHP not only fulfills the energy demand of the small communities of region, but is also viable economically along with job creation and revenue generation, and it supports the perspective of sustainable development. © 2008 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: The main goal of this study was to develop and compare two different techniques for classification of specific types of corneal shapes when Zernike coefficients are used as inputs. A feed-forward artificial Neural Network (NN) and discriminant analysis (DA) techniques were used. Methods: The inputs both for the NN and DA were the first 15 standard Zernike coefficients for 80 previously classified corneal elevation data files from an Eyesys System 2000 Videokeratograph (VK), installed at the Departamento de Oftalmologia of the Escola Paulista de Medicina, São Paulo. The NN had 5 output neurons which were associated with 5 typical corneal shapes: keratoconus, with-the-rule astigmatism, againstthe-rule astigmatism, "regular" or "normal" shape and post-PRK. Results: The NN and DA responses were statistically analyzed in terms of precision ([true positive+true negative]/total number of cases). Mean overall results for all cases for the NN and DA techniques were, respectively, 94% and 84.8%. Conclusion: Although we used a relatively small database, results obtained in the present study indicate that Zernike polynomials as descriptors of corneal shape may be a reliable parameter as input data for diagnostic automation of VK maps, using either NN or DA.

AB  - This paper presents a non-conventional approach for the automatic music genre classification problem. The proposed approach uses multiple feature vectors and a pattern recognition ensemble approach, according to space and time decomposition schemes. Despite being music genre classification a multi-class problem, we accomplish the task using a set of binary classifiers, whose results are merged in order to produce the final music genre label (space decomposition). Music segments are also decomposed according to time segments obtained from the beginning, middle and end parts of the original music signal (time-decomposition). The final classification is obtained from the set of individual results, according to a combination procedure. Classical machine learning algorithms such as Naïve-Bayes, Decision Trees, k Nearest-Neighbors, Support Vector Machines and MultiLayer Perceptron Neural Nets are employed. Experiments were carried out on a novel dataset called Latin Music Database, which contains 3,160 music pieces categorized in 10 musical genres. Experimental results show that the proposed ensemble approach produces better results than the ones obtained from global and individual segment classifiers in most cases. Some experiments related to feature selection were also conducted, using the genetic algorithm paradigm. They show that the most important features for the classification task vary according to their origin in the music signal.

AB  - Although several chemical elements were not known by end of the 18th century, Mendeleyev came up with an astonishing achievement: the periodic table of elements. He was not only able to predict the existence of (then) new elements but also to provide accurate estimates of their chemical and physical properties. This is certainly a relevant example of the human intelligence. Here, we intend to shed some light on the following question: Can an artificial intelligence system yield a classification of the elements that resembles, in some sense, the periodic table? To achieve our goal, we have fed a self-organized map (SOM) with information available at Mendeleyev's time. Our results show that similar elements tend to form individual clusters. Thus, SOM generates clusters of halogens, alkaline metals and transition metals that show a similarity with the periodic table of elements.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a multiresolution approach for surface reconstruction from clouds of unorganized points representing an object surface in 3-D space. The proposed method uses a set of mesh operators and simple rules for selective mesh refinement, with a strategy based on Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM). Basically, a self-adaptive scheme is used for iteratively moving vertices of an initial simple mesh in the direction of the set of points, ideally the object boundary. Successive refinement and motion of vertices are applied leading to a more detailed surface, in a multiresolution, iterative scheme. Reconstruction was experimented on with several point sets, including different shapes and sizes. Results show generated meshes very close to object final shapes. We include measures of performance and discuss robustness. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a complete differential protection system for power transformers, applying the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) theory. The proposed approach treat the classification of the protection system as a problem of pattern recognition and as an alternative method to the conventional algorithms. Several factors such as, for example, transformer energization and CT saturation can cause an inadequate operation of the protection relay. A complete protection system was developed, including an ANN-based device in substitution to harmonic filters in use in the conventional algorithm. This stage was carried out by a MLP Backpropagtion ANN to the signals classification. Some approaches concerning the reconstruction of the distorted signals caused by the CTs saturation are also proposed. This analysis was made by Elman recurrent ANNs used to reconstruct the distorted signals caused by CT saturation. These routines are added to the final protection algorithm. With the use of artificial intelligence tools in a complete power transformer protection algorithm, a very precise, fast and efficient solution was obtained, if compared to the conventional methods.

AB  - This work was performed with the aim of proposing an artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) as a function of geographic position coordinates and air temperature in the State of Rio de Janeiro. Data used for the network training were collected from 17 historical time series of climatic elements located in the State of Rio de Janeiro. The daily ETo calculated by Penman-Monteith (FAO-56) method was used as a reference for network training. ANNs of multilayer perceptron type were trained to estimate ETo as a function of latitude, longitude, altitude, mean air temperature, thermal daily amplitude and day of the year. After training with different network configurations, the one showing best performance was selected, and was composed by only one intermediary layer (with twenty neurons and sigmoid logistic activation function) and one output layer (with one neuron and linear activation function). According to the results obtained it can be concluded that, considering only geographical positioning coordinates and air temperature, it is possible to estimate daily ETo in 17 places of Rio de Janeiro State by using an ANN.

AB  - Successful transfer and uptake of qualitative reasoning technology for modelling and simulation in a variety of domains has been hampered by the lack of a structured methodology to support formalisation of ideas. We present a framework that structures and supports the capture of conceptual knowledge about system behaviour using a qualitative reasoning approach. This framework defines a protocol for representing content that supports the development of a conceptual understanding of systems and how they behave. The framework supports modellers in two ways. First, it structures and explicates the work involved in building models. Second, it facilitates easier comparison and evaluation of intermediate and final results of modelling efforts. We show how this framework has been used in developing qualitative reasoning models about three case studies of sustainable development in different river systems. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recently, we have built a classification model that is capable of assigning a given sesquiterpene lactone (STL) into exactly one tribe of the plant family Asteraceae from which the STL has been isolated. Although many plant species are able to biosynthesize a set of peculiar compounds, the occurrence of the same secondary metabolites in more than one tribe of Asteraceae is frequent. Building on our previous work, in this paper, we explore the possibility of assigning an STL to more than one tribe (class) simultaneously. When an object may belong to more than one class simultaneously, it is called multilabeled. In this work, we present a general overview of the techniques available to examine multilabeled data. The problem of evaluating the performance of a multilabeled classifier is discussed. Two particular multilabeled classification methods-cross-training with support vector machines (ct-SVM) and multilabeled k-nearest neighbors (ML-kNN)-were applied to the classification of the STLs into seven tribes from the plant family Asteraceae. The results are compared to a single-label classification and are analyzed from a chemotaxonomic point of view. The multilabeled approach allowed us to (1) model the reality as closely as possible, (2) improve our understanding of the relationship between the secondary metabolite profiles of different Asteraceae tribes, and (3) significantly decrease the number of plant sources to be considered for finding a certain STL. The presented classification models are useful for the targeted collection of plants with the objective of finding plant sources of natural compounds that are biologically active or possess other specific properties of interest. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This paper presents recent studies on clusters and cooperation networks of Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) carried out by the European Commission as well as a description of Germany, focusing on Berlin-Brandenburg. The main goal of this paper is to analyse the experience of the European and German initiatives and to define important alternatives to develop clusters and cooperation networks. As the main result, it can be observed that SMEs in clusters perform better than other SMEs. An approach is provided in Germany with the promotion of competence networks for innovation (Kompetenznetze Deutschland). The region Berlin-Brandenburg shows on a regional level what a local strategy could be like. It could be said that possible alternatives would be a more direct support by the government, a stronger focus on innovation, and the definition of management processes for cooperation networks, all of them oriented under a perspective of a sustainable development.

AB  - In this work, a systematic method to support the building of bioprocess models through the use of different optimization techniques is presented. The method was applied to a tower bioreactor for bioethanol production with immobilized cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Specifically, a step-by-step procedure to the estimation problem is proposed. As the first step, the potential of global searching of real-coded genetic algorithm (RGA) was applied for simultaneous estimation of the parameters. Subsequently, the most significant parameters were identified using the Placket-Burman (PB) design. Finally, the quasi-Newton algorithm (QN) was used for optimization of the most significant parameters, near the global optimum region, as the initial values were already determined by the RGA global-searching algorithm. The results have shown that the performance of the estimation procedure applied in a deterministic detailed model to describe the experimental data is improved using the proposed method (RGA-PB-QN) in comparison with a model whose parameters were only optimized by RGA. © 2007 Humana Press Inc.

AB  - We describe an automated multidimensional approach for the analysis of flow cytometry data based on pattern classification. Flow cytometry is a widely used technique both for research and clinical purposes where it has become essential for the diagnosis and follow up of a wide spectrum of diseases, such as HIV-infection and neoplastic disorders. Flow cytometry data sets are composed of quite a large number of observations that can be viewed as elements of a n-dimensional space. The aim of the analysis of such data files is typically to classify groups of cellular events as specific populations with biological meaning. Despite significant improvements in data acquisition capabilities of flow cytometers, data analysis is still based on bi-dimensional strategies which were defined a long time ago. These are strongly dependent on the expertise of an expert operator, this approach being relatively subjective and potentially leading to unreliable results. Automated analysis of flow cytometry data is an essential step to improve reproducibility of the results. The proposed automated analysis was implemented on peripherial blood lymphocyte subsets from 307 samples stained and prepared in an identical way and it was capable of identifying all cell subsets present in each sample studied that could also be detected in the same data files by an expert operator. A highly significant correlation was found between the results obtained by an expert operator using a conventional manual method of analysis and those obtained using the implemented automated approach. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: To develop a model to predict the bleeding source and identify the cohort amongst patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who require urgent intervention, including endoscopy. Patients with acute GIB, an unpredictable event, are most commonly evaluated and managed by non-gastroenterologists. Rapid and consistently reliable risk stratification of patients with acute GIB for urgent endoscopy may potentially improve outcomes amongst such patients by targeting scarce healthcare resources to those who need it the most. Design and methods: Using ICD-9 codes for acute GIB, 189 patients with acute GIB and all available data variables required to develop and test models were identified from a hospital medical records database. Data on 122 patients was utilized for development of the model and on 67 patients utilized to perform comparative analysis of the models. Clinical data such as presenting signs and symptoms, demographic data, presence of co-morbidities, laboratory data and corresponding endoscopic diagnosis and outcomes were collected. Clinical data and endoscopic diagnosis collected for each patient was utilized to retrospectively ascertain optimal management for each patient. Clinical presentations and corresponding treatment was utilized as training examples. Eight mathematical models including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), shrunken centroid (SC), random forest (RF), logistic regression, and boosting were trained and tested. The performance of these models was compared using standard statistical analysis and ROC curves. Results: Overall the random forest model best predicted the source, need for resuscitation, and disposition with accuracies of approximately 80% or higher (accuracy for endoscopy was greater than 75%). The area under ROC curve for RF was greater than 0.85, indicating excellent performance by the random forest model. Conclusion: While most mathematical models are effective as a decision support system for evaluation and management of patients with acute GIB, in our testing, the RF model consistently demonstrated the best performance. Amongst patients presenting with acute GIB, mathematical models may facilitate the identification of the source of GIB, need for intervention and allow optimization of care and healthcare resource allocation; these however require further validation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to help nuclear power plant operator reduce his cognitive load and increase his available time to maintain the plant operating in a safe condition, transient identification systems have been devised to help operators identify possible plant transients and take fast and right corrective actions in due time. In the design of classification systems for identification of nuclear power plants transients, several artificial intelligence techniques, involving expert systems, neuro-fuzzy and genetic algorithms have been used. In this work we explore the ability of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) as a tool for optimizing a distance-based discrimination transient classification method, giving also an innovative solution for searching the best set of prototypes for identification of transients. The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm was successfully applied to the optimization of a nuclear power plant transient identification problem. Comparing the PSO to similar methods found in literature it has shown better results. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Systems of distributed artificial intelligence can be powerful tools in a wide variety of practical applications. Its most surprising characteristic, the emergent behavior, is also the most answerable for the difficulty in projecting these systems. This work proposes a tool capable to beget individual strategies for the elements of a multi-agent system and thereof providing to the group means on obtaining wanted results, working in a coordinated and cooperative manner as well. As an application example, a problem was taken as a basis where a predators' group must catch a prey in a three-dimensional continuous ambient. A synthesis of system strategies was implemented of which internal mechanism involves the integration between simulators by Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO), a Swarm Intelligence technique. The system had been tested in several simulation settings and it was capable to synthesize automatically successful hunting strategies, substantiating that the developed tool can provide, as long as it works with well-elaborated patterns, satisfactory solutions for problems of complex nature, of difficult resolution starting from analytical approaches. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Reservoir management is an essential task aimed at the challenge of optimizing the exploration of petroliferous reservoirs. In response to such a challenge, the oil and gas industry has been developing new technologies, such as intelligent wells. These wells areintended to reduce the costs of the more commonplace restoring operations by controlling their technology. This work studies the development of intelligent fields and introduces a decision taking support system able to optimize, through evolutionary algorithms, the intelligent well technology control process considering the technical uncertainties: in valves and geological failures. Moreover, the system proposes to support decision taking, to use or not intelligent wells, given a reservoir ready to be explored or to receive expansion investments. The optimization seeks a strategy of pro-active control, in other words, act before the effect, seeking in the initial production times a configuration of valves capable of delaying the arrival of the water cut of the production wells, accelerate the oil production or to improve the oil recovery. As a result, an operation that maximizes the NPV (Net present value). The model was tested in three reservoirs, the first being a synthetic reservoir, and the others with more realistic characteristics.

AB  - This chapter aims at presenting an overview of two Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques: Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). It will present two implementation models, one for each technique, proposed by the Technology and Science Center (CCT) of the Catholic University of Brasília (UCB), in Brazil. Afterwards, a case study will show the results of the implementation of those models in the context of IACVIRTUAL, which is a project of a Webbased Virtual Medical Office that has been developed by the researchers of CCT. Therefore, the chapter will provide a practical demonstration of the application of CBR and GA in the field of Health, specifically as to the support to diagnosis. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This paper deals with the problem of fault section estimation in electric power systems, undertaken at a control center level and using information about the operation of protection relays and circuit breakers. The developed methodology should be used after the occurrence of contingencies with definitive disconnections, and before beginning the process of network restoration. Due to the absence of an analytic formulation, the problem calls for the use of artificial-intelligence techniques, such as neural networks and expert systems. Neural networks are employed to model the protection systems, dealing with the uncertainties involved with relay and circuit-breaker operation messages. An expert system is used to complement the results provided by the neural networks, considering the network topology. The results show that the developed methodology is applicable to real large-scale power systems. In addition, it is capable of noise suppression in relay and circuit-breaker trip messages, treats multiple faults naturally, and infers a solution even in cases when remote backup protection action occurs. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a computational approach for an offline measurement-based design of an optimal damping controller using adaptive critics for a new type of flexible ac transmission system device-the gate-controlled series capacitor (GCSC). Remote measurements are provided to the controller to damp out system modes. The optimal controller is developed based on the heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) approach. Three multilayer-perceptron neural networks are used in the design-the identifier/model network to identify the dynamics of the power system, the critic network to evaluate the performance of the damping controller, and the controller network to provide optimal damping. This measurement-based technique provides an alternative to the classical linear model-based optimal control design. The eigenvalue analysis of the closed-loop system is performed with time-domain responses using the Prony method. An analysis of the simulation results shows potential of the HDP-based optimal damping controller on a GCSC for enhancing the stability of the power system. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Data assimilation is an essential step for improving space weather forecasting by means of a weighted combination between observational data and data from a mathematical model. In the present work data assimilation methods based on Kalman filter (KF) and artificial neural networks are applied to a three-wave model of auroral radio emissions. A novel data assimilation method is presented, whereby a multilayer perceptron neural network is trained to emulate a KF for data assimilation by using cross-validation. The results obtained render support for the use of neural networks as an assimilation technique for space weather prediction. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is currently one of the most widely used methods for studying human brain function in vivo. Although many different approaches to fMRI analysis are available, the most widely used methods employ so called "mass-univariate" modeling of responses in a voxel-by-voxel fashion to construct activation maps. However, it is well known that many brain processes involve networks of interacting regions and for this reason multivariate analyses might seem to be attractive alternatives to univariate approaches. The current paper focuses on one multivariate application of statistical learning theory: the statistical discrimination maps (SDM) based on support vector machine, and seeks to establish some possible interpretations when the results differ from univariate approaches. In fact, when there are changes not only on the activation level of two conditions but also on functional connectivity, SDM seems more informative. We addressed this question using both simulations and applications to real data. We have shown that the combined use of univariate approaches and SDM yields significant new insights into brain activations not available using univariate methods alone. In the application to a visual working memory fMRI data, we demonstrated that the interaction among brain regions play a role in SDM's power to detect discriminative voxels. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: A goal of proteomics is to distinguish between states of a biological system by identifying protein expression differences. Liu et al. demonstrated a method to perform semi-relative protein quantitation in shotgun proteomics data by correlating the number of tandem mass spectra obtained for each protein, or "spectral count", with its abundance in a mixture; however, two issues have remained open: how to normalize spectral counting data and how to efficiently pinpoint differences between profiles. Moreover, Chen et al. recently showed how to increase the number of identified proteins in shotgun proteomics by analyzing samples with different MS-compatible detergents while performing proteolytic digestion. The latter introduced new challenges as seen from the data analysis perspective, since replicate readings are not acquired. Results: To address the open issues above, we present a program termed PatternLab for proteomics. This program implements existing strategies and adds two new methods to pinpoint differences in protein profiles. The first method, ACFold, addresses experiments with less than three replicates from each state or having assays acquired by different protocols as described by Chen et al. ACFold uses a combined criterion based on expression fold changes, the AC test, and the false-discovery rate, and can supply a "bird's-eye view" of differentially expressed proteins. The other method addresses experimental designs having multiple readings from each state and is referred to as nSVM (natural support vector machine) because of its roots in evolutionary computing and in statistical learning theory. Our observations suggest that nSVM's niche comprises projects that select a minimum set of proteins for classification purposes; for example, the development of an early detection kit for a given pathology. We demonstrate the effectiveness of each method on experimental data and confront them with existing strategies. Conclusion: PatternLab offers an easy and unified access to a variety of feature selection and normalization strategies, each having its own niche. Additionally, graphing tools are available to aid in the analysis of high throughput experimental data.

AB  - The authors consider the analysis and modelling of the scattering from frequency-selective surfaces (FSSs), in the 6-14GHz band, as a function of its periodic array geometry of thin dipole elements on an anisotropic layer. The accurate full-wave electromagnetic (EM) analysis of each FSS was carried out using the method of moments. From the available EM data, the artificial neural network (ANN) models can be developed. The modelling problem was solved by using a new modular configuration of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), which is an implementation of the proposal modified from the previous knowledge method of neuromodelling information. Each MLP in the modular configuration was trained separately from the others through the resilient backpropagation algorithm. Within the region of interest studied, the ANN model developed is able to estimate the resonance frequencies and the bandwidths of the FSS band-stop filters, with high accuracy and low computational cost. To verify the advantageous properties of the modular MLP/MLP model, a neural model using a simple MLP was developed in order to analyse the same learning task. A comparative study was done between these models in terms of training the convergence, the accuracy and the computational cost. © 2008 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - Industrial processes are becoming progressively more and more unmanned and dependent on control components, so that the way to improve the processes confidence is by promoting reliability and robustness of these process components. However, a defect-free process is yet impossible to guarantee. Defects in control systems can show up in an abrupt or gradual (incipient) way. The last one is to cause progressive losses in performance and is extremely difficult to detect as its effects are covered by the manipulated variables of the control loops. This paper proposes a method for the detection of incipient defects in control system by the use of neural networks components. The development of this paper was split into two parts: i) the first one devoted to the monitoring, ii) the second to the classification. In the first part, the almost static behaviour of the system has been modelled in neural networks. The comparison between inferred values by the model and measurement performed in the field generated the residues. In the next step the second neural network, the classification form, was built to analyze the residue. The training process of this neural network was carried out with two sorts of database, i) one of them defects-free ii) the second one holding defects in one of the process control system elements. Due to difficulties of inserting defects in critical processes sensors during its normal operation, it was proposed a method for the generation of simulated defects by the use of a proper developed neural model. The method was applied in the secondary air system of the chemical recovery boiler operating in a pulp and paper mill. Both neural networks were programmed in an Excel software platform so as to make possible the continuous monitoring of the production process. The Plant Information (PI), a commercial software, was used for the continuous process data input in an Excel spreadsheet. The choice for the Excel platform and PI system was due to their existing availability in the plant where the system was built, and also because their friendly use by the process operational staff. The system was kept in use for continual process monitoring during two normal operation months, and the rate of false alarms was of just 4.0%. Errors of up to 20% in magnitude were simulated in manipulated variables of the control system for checking the performance of the method. Within the range of 10% magnitude of the simulated errors the rate of defects detection was in the range of 97.1%.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach for dealing with the structural risk minimization (SRM) applied to a general setting of the machine learning problem. The formulation is based on the fundamental concept that supervised learning is a bi-objective optimization problem in which two conflicting objectives should be minimized. The objectives are related to the empirical training error and the machine complexity. In this paper, one general Q-norm method to compute the machine complexity is presented, and, as a particular practical case, the minimum gradient method (MGM) is derived relying on the definition of the fat-shattering dimension. A practical mechanism for parallel layer perceptron (PLP) network training, involving only quasi-convex functions, is generated using the aforementioned definitions. Experimental results on 15 different benchmarks are presented, which show the potential of the proposed ideas. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - This study focuses in the mathematical modelling of the enzymic synthesis of amoxicillin by the reaction of p-hydroxyphenylglycine methyl ester and 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6APA), catalyzed by penicillin G acylase (PGA) immobilized on glutaraldehyde-chitosan, at 25°C and pH 6.5. Previous work on the kinetics and mechanism of reaction showed that the use of neural networks seems to be an interesting alternative to simulate experimental data of antibiotic production. Therefore, two feedforward neural networks, with one hidden layer, were trained and used to forecast the rates of amoxicillin and p-hydroxyphenylglycine (POHPG) net production. First of all, some parameters that affect the network performed were investigated, such as the number of nodes between the input and hidden layers and the number of interactions during the learning phase. Afterwards, hybrid models that coupled artificial neural networks to mass-balance equations were used to reproduce the performance of batch reactors for the production of amoxicillin. This approach provided accurate results, within the range of substrate concentration studied. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The Time-delay Added Evolutionary Forecasting (TAEF) approach is a new method for time series prediction that performs an evolutionary search for the minimum number of dimensions necessary to represent the underlying information that generates the time series. The methodology proposed is inspired in Takens theorem and consists of an intelligent hybrid model composed of an artificial neural network combined with a modified genetic algorithm. Initially, the TAEF method finds the best fitted model to forecast the series and then performs a behavioral statistical test in order to adjust time phase distortions that may appear in the representation of some series. An experimental investigation conducted with relevant time series show the robustness of the method through a comparison, according to several performance measures, to previous results found in the literature and those obtained with more traditional methods. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This paper introduces an approach called Clustering and Co-evolution to Construct Neural Network Ensembles (CONE). This approach creates neural network ensembles in an innovative way, by explicitly partitioning the input space through a clustering method. The clustering method allows a reduction in the number of nodes of the neural networks that compose the ensemble, thus reducing the execution time of the learning process. This is an important characteristic especially when evolutionary algorithms are used. The clustering method also ensures that different neural networks specialize in different regions of the input space, working in a divide-and-conquer way, to maintain and improve the accuracy. Besides, the clustering method facilitates the understanding of the system and makes a straightforward distributed implementation possible. The experiments performed with seven classification databases and three different co-evolutionary algorithms show that CONE considerably reduces the execution time without prejudicing (and even improving) the accuracy, even when a distributed implementation is not used. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this work is to evaluate the reliability of non-destructive test (NDT) techniques for the inspection of pipeline welds employed in the petroleum industry. Radiography, manual and automatic ultrasonic techniques using pulse-echo and time of flight diffraction (TOFD) were employed. Three classes of defects were analyzed: lack of penetration (LP), lack of fusion (LF) and undercut (UC). The tests were carried out on specimen made from pipelines containing defects, which had been artificially inserted on laying the weld bead. The results showed the superiority of the automatic ultrasonic tests for defect detection compared with the manual ultrasonic and radiographic tests. Additionally, artificial neural networks (ANN) were used in the detection and automatic classification of the defects. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nonlinear system identification poses challenging questions because a closed general theory is not available for this field. Particularly, nonlinear models based on neural networks (NN) may present incompatible general dynamic process behavior, leading to improper closed-loop responses, even when they allow for satisfactory one step ahead prediction of process dynamics, as required by traditional validation methods. It is shown here that performing detailed bifurcation and stability analysis may be very helpful for the adequate development and implementation of nonlinear models and model based controllers. The study of many parameters that are defined a priori during the training of the NN shows that the spurious dynamic behavior is related mostly to the use of incomplete data sets during the learning process. This is an indication that, for each kind of process, the number, range and distribution of the data points in the operation region of interest are of paramount importance for proper training of the nonlinear model. Strategies to improve the quality of the training procedure are provided and analyzed both theoretically and experimentally, using the solution polymerization of styrene in a tubular reactor as a case study. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
